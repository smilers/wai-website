## Project Results
{:#results}

**[List of Courses on Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/list/)**
:  Includes developing a user interface with filtering functionality, a taxonomy to describe courses and certification on digital accessibility with mapping to the [WAI Curricula](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/), and promoting and gathering list entries. In addition to the List of Courses, a [Course submission form](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/submission/) is available.

**[List of Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/)**
:  Includes updating the user interface with filtering functionality, reviewing tools features to capture, and promoting and gathering list entries. In addition to the List of Evaluation Tools, a [Tool submission form](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/submit-a-tool/) is available.

**[List of Policies and Practices Internationally](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/)**
:  Extensive updates to existing policies and the addition of new information for 22 additional countries.

**[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/)**
:  Includes promoting, tracking, and validating implementations of "Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules" in automated testing tools and manual testing methodologies. This includes completed [redesign of the user interface](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/) to better integrate implementation reports submitted by different vendors.

**Analysis of Support and Gaps in Technologies**
:  Carried out an extensive review of literature to identify relevant accessibility related gaps in digital technologies which helped identify topics that were explored further as part of the Research Symposia.

**Research Symposia on Digital Accessibility**
: Organised and ran three online research symposia based on topics identified in previous analysis:
  * [Shape the Future: Research and Development Questions in Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-coop/symposium1/)
  * [Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/research/ai2023/)
  * [Evaluating Accessibility: Meeting Key Challenges](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-coop/symposium3/)

**Regular Open Meetings**
: Organised and ran six open meetings to exchange best practices and discuss specific topics around implementing and monitoring accessibility.
  * [WAI-CooP introductory meeting](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-first-open-meeting/)
  * [Implementation of the EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting2/)
  * [Monitoring of the EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-online-meeting/)
  * [What can be done to improve supply of and access to digital accessibility expertise](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting-11-october-2022/)
  * [Exploring the feedback mechanism and complaints procedure of the Web Accessibility Directive](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting-7-march-2023/)
  * [Review of WAI CooP activities and the future of accessibility](https://www.edf-feph.org/events-slug/wai-coop-open-meeting-14-november-2023/)

**[Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://web-directive.eu/)**
:  Provides responses to frequently asked questions (FAQ) on implementing the EU Web Accessibility Directive (WAD). Stakeholders can ask new questions from the "Contact our help desk" link.

**[EM Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/)**
:  Updated functionality, improved user interface, improved translation options and updates to include new WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 success criteria.
EM Report Tool

**[Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/easy-checks/)**
:  Updates to the resource to simplify the presentation of each check, reduce the reliance on third-party tools and improve the readability of the content. This aims to make it easier to be used as a learning resource for people new to accessibility and a set of tools to perform some basic accessibility checks.

## About the Project
{:#about}

WAI-CooP, Communities of Practice, is a Coordination and Support Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 101004794). The project is schedule to start on 1 January 2021 for a duration of three years. WAI-CooP support implementation of the international standards for digital accessibility through:

-   Establishing vendor-neutral overview on available training, tools, and resources internationally
-   Analyzing technological advancements and coordinating with relevant research and development
-   Providing opportunities for key stakeholders to share resources and to exchange best practices

WAI-CooP achieves this by building on the existing wealth of authoritative guidance available from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), to provide a one-stop shop for the broad spectrum of key stakeholders involved in the implementation of digital accessibility. This includes public bodies and private entities; organisations representing people with disabilities; product, service, and training providers; researchers; and policy makers.
