  <h2>1. Problem Addressed</h2>
  <p>
    The adoption of policies and laws at international, European and national levels has placed accessibility at the forefront, requiring the countries of the European Union to ensure that any user can access and interact with any software, web content, documents
    and hardware regardless of their capabilities. As stated by the
    <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-2.html">
        United Nations Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities
        (UNCRPD)</a
      >, accessibility is a right to equal opportunities for all citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2010, the UNCRPD was ratified by the European Union and the EU Member
      States and consequently a solid legislative framework for improving the
      situation of people with disabilities was created. At the legislative
      level there are three key directives that regulate accessibility in the
      European Union: the
      <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj"
        >Web Accessibility Directive (2016)</a
      >, the updated
      <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2018/1808/oj"
        >Audiovisual Communication Services Directive (2018)</a
      >
      and the
      <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj">
        European Accessibility Act (2019)</a
      >. The standardisation agencies of each Member State must adapt their laws
      to transpose this legislative framework in their countries, in order to
      ensure access to media and digital content for all citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015, a UN committee conducted its first review of how the EU complies
      with the UNCRPD. The Committee noted that the EU institutions needed to
      make more efforts to fulfill their commitment to make communication
      accessible to people with disabilities. In a decision of the <a href='https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/decision/en/107967'>European
      Ombudsman (Strategic Survey OI /June 2017 6/2017 /EA)</a> on how the European Commission ensures that people with disabilities can access its websites from December 2018, clearly states that there is a need for Mandatory accessibility training
    for all staff working on websites. Hence the creation of the IMPACT project.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Relevant background</h2>
  <p>
    The IMPACT project (Inclusive Method based on the Perception of Accessibility and Compliance Testing), aims to define the skills and competencies that an educator or mediator in ICT accessibility should acquire and master, for the correct implementation
    of the harmonized European accessibility standard digital EN 301 549.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a strategic partnership bringing together parties from different fields dealing with innovation in higher education, with the main aim of designing, testing and certifying a modular curriculum in digital accessibility for vocational and academic
    training that meets the needs of the labor market and society.
  </p>
  <p>
    The IMPACT project training will prepare for three different work environments: face-to-face, online and relay. This opens up new employment opportunities for people with and without disabilities. The main objectives of the IMPACT project are to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Map the current situation of digital accessibility practices in terms of training and practice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Define the skills framework for a new professional profile “Digital Accessibility Educator/Mediator”
    </li>
    <li>Generate recommendations for digital accessibility training.</li>
    <li>Develop open source training materials.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    The recent adoption and entry into force of these legislative framework has highlighted the scarce training in digital accessibility outside of the technological field (Oncins et al., 2020). Hence, there is a need to provide training in digital accessibility
    with a more empathetic driven perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2019 the European Disability Forum (EDF) conducted a survey on <a href='https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2019-50/2__20191128_-_wadex_meeting-_edf_survey_56567D23-D385-3C12-490359C9239C0034_63666.pptx'> “Web
      Accessibility Directive transposition and implementation”</a> with the objective of measuring awareness regarding: Transposition, Implementation, Accessibility statement, Feedback and enforcement mechanisms. The reported results stated that 42%
    of users are not (very) satisfied with the “Web Accessibility Directive transposition and implementation” and the majority of new websites (80%) are found not accessible. Hence, there is a need to improve training on digital accessibility in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2019, during the a first stage of the IMPACT project a <a href='https://impact-access.eu/Digital-Accessibility-Educator-a-skill-card'>survey was
      conducted</a> and it was reported that while most participants are familiar or very familiar with the European Web Accessibility Directive and the international standard WCAG 2.0/2.1., the Standard EN301549 which actually helps and guides organisations
    to be accessible remains largely unknown. Hence there is a need to developing specific training for the correct implementation of the European standard EN30149.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    The IMPACT project survey included the following four proposed competences to be validated by participants: 1) Understanding digital accessibility, 2) Digital Accessibility context and digital accessibility services, 3) Implementing Digital accessibility
    and 4) Digital accessibility promotion. The results obtained reported that all competences are very important or important. The competence with the highest score was ‘implementing digital accessibility’, followed by ‘understanding digital accessibility’
    and ‘digital accessibility promotion’, and finally ‘digital accessibility context and digital accessibility services’.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a second stage of the project a <a href='https://impact-access.eu/Building-a-Modular-Curriculum-for-Digital-Accessibility-Educator-training'>modular curriculum</a> was created inline with the <a href='http://www.jobcertification.eu/index.php'>ECQA guidelines</a>,
    which is the IMPACT partner for the job certification. It was validated with five focus groups that were conducted in three different countries (France, Ireland and Spain). An overview of the course curriculum is described below:
  </p>
  <p>
    Unit 1 Understanding digital accessibility:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic concepts</li>
    <li>Target groups and their needs</li>
    <li>Accessibility context</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Unit 2 Digital accessibility context and digital accessibility services
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Accessible web</li>
    <li>Accessible services</li>
    <li>Accessibility tools</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unit 3 Implementing digital accessibility</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting started with web accessibility</li>
    <li>Accessibility management</li>
    <li>Accessibility toolkit for adults</li>
    <li>Sensibilisation toolkit for children</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Unit 4 Digital accessibility promotion</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accessibility needs and benefits</li>
    <li>Stakeholder involvement</li>
    <li>ccessible communication</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Future perspectives</h2>
  <p>
    The IMPACT project partners are currently creating four different types of course materials for the course: video lectures, workshops, study cases and quizzes, which will be part of the IMPACT course.
