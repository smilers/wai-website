## Project Results

### Supplemental resource framework redesign

New styling was developed for use in Supplemental resources to:

* improve the visual design for readability
* improve navigation within pages
* improve navigation between related documents
* make it easier for readers new to WCAG to get information about the page they land on
* improve consistency across all resources

This was applied to:

* [Understanding for WCAG 2](/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/)
* [Techniques for WCAG 2](/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/)
* [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
* [Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules](/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/)
* [Cognitive Accessibility Guidance](/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/#cognitiveaccessibilityguidance)

### Expanded Technical Guidance

Technical guidance was expanded to better address current and emerging technologies. The specific areas covered were:

* [Design Guide for Cognitive Accessibility](/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/#cognitiveaccessibilityguidance)
* [Immersive Environment requirements in WCAG3](/TR/xaur/)
* [Functional Needs in WCAG3](https://w3c.github.io/fast/)

### Video Training Materials

Created four sets of videos to support training of accessibility skills.

* [Web Accessibility Evaluation](/WAI/test-evaluate/) - Five animated videos that help explain the topic 'web accessibility evaluation'.
* [Stories of Web Users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5dMdJzUy7w&list=PLhDEeYUfW02SJU-GQ1tagtChv7YmzSoQT) - Eight videos presenting stories of how people with disabilities use digital technology.
* [Diverse Abilities and Barriers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UaUSbyVFjk&list=PLhDEeYUfW02SyKyI4cq-kpeGIBH6aTFHb) - Five videos that present the wide range of diversity of people and abilities, and highlight some of the types of barriers that people commonly encounter due to inaccessible design.
* [Tools and Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xF23iGIAPE&list=PLhDEeYUfW02QfCwXHtNKyqi31UPuuaAlO) - Four videos that present techniques and tools that people with disabilities use to interact with the Web.

### Accessibility Curricula

Created a framework to support the development of courses on digital accessibility, as well as the inclusion of digital accessibility in courses for related areas. The curricula covered four core modules:

* [Foundation Modules](/WAI/curricula/foundation-modules/) - helps introducing web accessibility to any students with a basic understanding of computers and the Web.
* [Developer Modules](/WAI/curricula/developer-modules/) - helps create courses that explain accessible coding for developers.
* [Designer Modules](/WAI/curricula/designer-modules/) - helps create courses that explain how design principles and practices relate to accessibility.
* [Content Author Modules](/WAI/curricula/content-author-modules/) - helps create courses that explain how to create clear content and discusses accessible authoring techniques.

### Authoring Tool Briefs

Created three short briefs framing the importance of the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines](/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/) to key authoring tool domains.

* [For LMS](/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/education/) - provides an introduction to help make learning management systems (LMS) and other education tools accessible to people with disabilities.
* [For No-Code Tools](/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/no-code/) - provides an introduction to help make no-code website tools accessible to creators, designers, and end users with disabilities.
* [For Social Media Platforms](/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/social-media/) - provides an introduction to help make social media platforms accessible to creators and users with disabilities

### Authoring Tools List

[Authoring Tools List](/WAI/tools-list/authoring/) - Provides a resource that lists authoring tool vendor submitted information about the accessibility of their tools.

### Authoring Tools Conformance Evaluation Report Tool

[ATAG Report Tool](/WAI/atag/report-tool/) leads the user step-by-step through the requirements defined by the W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines and allows the user to record the results for each requirement. The tool generates a report based on this input by the user in HTML and in JSON formats.

### New User Needs

Identified and explored accessibility gaps in new standards for emerging technologies. This work developed four new user requirements documents:

* [XR Accessibility User Requirements](/TR/xaur/) - covers user needs and requirements for people with disabilities when using virtual reality or immersive environments, augmented or mixed reality, and other related technologies (XR).
* [Natural Language Accessibility User Requirements](/TR/naur/) - outlines accessibility-related user needs, requirements and scenarios for natural language interfaces.
* [Synchronized Media Accessibility User Requirements](/TR/saur/) - identifies and summarizes relevant research regarding the synchronization of resources presented in multimedia content.
* [Framework for Accessible Specification of Technology](https://w3c.github.io/fast/) - advises creators of technical specifications how to ensure that their technology meets the needs of users with disabilities.

## About the Project
{:#about}

WAI-Guide, Authoritative Implementation Guidance and International Cooperation to Support Training, Awareness Raising, and Capacity Building, was a Support Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 822245). The project started on 1 January 2019 and completed in December 2022. WAI-Guide aimed to:

-   Provide authoritative implementation guidance and training, thereby growing capacities of available accessibility experts;
-   Accelerate tooling support for accessible content authoring, thereby making it more cost efficient to create accessible content;
-   Identify and address gaps in accessibility standardization, thereby increasing the coverage of digital accessibility requirements.

WAI-Guide achieved this by conducting its work as an integral part of the vendor-neutral environment of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WAI-Guide drew together expertise from industry, end-user representation, public bodies, research, and other fields, to develop core accessibility solutions that are internationally consensed and recognized as authoritative references.
