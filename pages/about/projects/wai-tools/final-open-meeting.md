We encouraged participation from people interested in:

-   Large-scale web accessibility monitoring
-   Managing the quality assurance process

We particularly invited participants involved in related efforts in Europe and internationally, with interest in accessibility conformance testing. This final Open Meeting was held **online on Tuesday 26 January 2021 at [14:00 to 17:00 Central European Time (CET)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=WAI-Tools+Final+Open+Meeting&iso=20210126T13&p1=1440&ah=3&am=00).**

## Background
{:#background}

The [WAI-Tools Project](/about/projects/wai-tools/) drove web accessibility evaluation and repair by carrying out key efforts in the vendor-neutral environment of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It drew together key expertise from industry, public bodies, and research to develop common understanding of web accessibility requirements.

This final Open Meeting was held as part of the project efforts to engage with the broader community throughout the development of the project deliverables, to help ensure consensus and uptake by European and international stakeholders. Participants learned about the objectives and deliverables of the project, final project results, and about opportunities for participation and collaboration beyond the project.

## Agenda
{:#agenda}

WAI-Tool staff presented project deliverables and highlighted particular points for collaboration. Participants are invited to provide input on potential aspects to consider throughout the project.
