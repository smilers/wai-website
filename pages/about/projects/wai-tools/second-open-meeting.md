## Invitation
{:#invitation}

[WAI-Tools Project](/about/projects/wai-tools/) invited web accessibility practitioners, evaluation and quality assurance tools vendors, researchers, and users to participate in an Open Meeting to:

-   Learn more about the WAI-Tools Project
-   Provide input into project developments
-   Explore opportunities for collaboration

We encouraged participation from people interested in:

-   Web accessibility evaluation and testing
-   Large-scale web accessibility monitoring
-   Managing the quality assurance process

We particularly invited participants involved in related efforts in Europe and internationally, with interest in accessibility conformance testing. **Meeting was on Monday 20 May 2019 at 10:00 to 17:00 in Brussels, Belgium.**

## Background
{:#background}

The [WAI-Tools Project](/about/projects/wai-tools/) drove web accessibility evaluation and repair by carrying out key efforts in the vendor-neutral environment of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It drew together key expertise from industry, public bodies, and research to develop common understanding of web accessibility requirements.

This Open Meeting was held as part of the project efforts to engage with the broader community throughout the development of the project deliverables, to help ensure consensus and uptake by European and international stakeholders. Participants learned about the objectives and deliverables of the project, interim project results, and about potential opportunities for participation and collaboration.
