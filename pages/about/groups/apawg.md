The mission of the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group (APA WG) is to ensure W3C specifications provide support for accessibility to people with disabilities. The group advances this mission through review of W3C specifications, development of technical support materials, collaboration with other Working Groups, and coordination of harmonized accessibility strategies within W3C.

Some information on this page is also shown on, and may be more current in, the automatically generated [Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group page](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/).

The APA WG is engaged on the following work:

- Publications: The Working Group maintains a comprehensive list of publications and status](/about/groups/apawg/deliverables/), which include:
    - Several [Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/?filter-tr-name=accessibility+user+requirements) guides for specific technologies;
    - [Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies](https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/) plus [FAST checklist](https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/checklist.html),
    - [Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA](https://w3c.github.io/apa/captcha/),
    - [Spoken Presentation technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/?filter-tr-name=spoken+presentation) to provide for proper pronunciation in HTML content when using text to speech (TTS) synthesis,
    - [WAI-Adapt technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/?filter-tr-name=WAI-Adapt) to enable design of sites in a way that they can be personalized to the needs of each user allows more optimal accessibility.
- Specification reviews: input is solicited on the [WAI Interest Group mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/), tracked in the [APA specification review wiki pages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/Category:Spec_Review)and comments are copied to the [public-apa mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-apa/).
- Community groups: the Working Group maintains a [list of community groups to track](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/Community_Groups).

The [APA Project Plan](/about/groups/apawg/deliverables/) details intended timeline and milestones for this work.

## Horizontal Review

The APA Working Group performs [accessibility horizontal review](https://www.w3.org/wiki/DocumentReview) of other technologies under development by W3C. Documents reviewed from 2015 to present are shown in the [Specification Review list](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/Category:Spec_Review). Active reviews under way are shown in the [Accessibility Review Comment Tracker](https://w3c.github.io/horizontal-issue-tracker/?repo=w3c/a11y-review). The group also reviews [charters of groups](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Horizontal+review+requested%22%22) to check that deliverables and liaisons reflect accessibility needs.

To request review of a GitHub issue from the APA, add the "a11y-tracker" label to the issue. If the APA files an issue or agrees to comment on an issue, the label will be changed to "a11y-needs-resolution". To request review outside of a GitHub issue context, send email to [group-apa-chairs@w3.org](mailto:group-apa-chairs@w3.org).
