## Spoken Presentation Overview

[Spoken Presentation Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/pronunciation/) provides an overview of the overall pronunciation technique in W3C.

## Spoken Presentation Video

There is also a short [pronunciation technical video](https://ln.sync.com/dl/10e1a9c60/92faztk9-he4wbve6-twt5jp3h-zuh6brfd) available, it shows the demo of pronunciation technical and approaches for controlling pronunciation in spans of web content where uniform markup can make the difference.

## Meetings and Communication

The APA WG conducts its work using a variety of synchronous and asynchronous tools:

- [Teleconferences of the Spoken Presentation Task Force](#teleconferences);
- Face to face meetings (The Task Force will plan a face-to-face meeting at a later stage.);
- [Email lists](#mailing-lists);
- IRC discussion on the [#pronunciation](irc://irc.w3.org/pronunciation) IRCchannel, used largely for minute-taking;
- [Spoken Presentation source repository](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/);
- [Wiki](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/wiki/);
- [Web-Based Surveys (WBS)](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/110437/);
- [Spoken Presentation Issue Tracker](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/pronunciation/track/);
- [Spoken Presentation source repository issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/pronunciation/issues);
- [Current participants in the Spoken Presentation Task Force](https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=110437&public=1).

These tools are used by participants of the Task Force. For ways non-participants can contribute, see [how to contribute to the Working Group and file comments](/about/groups/apawg/contribute/).
