The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (Cognitive A11Y TF) is a joint Task Force of the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/) and the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](/about/groups/agwg/). It assists these Working Groups to produce techniques, understanding, and guidance documents, as well as updates to existing related W3C material that addresses the cognitive space.

## Meetings and Communication

The Coga TF conducts its work using a variety of synchronous and asynchronous tools. Most work is done via email and issues as shown below, supplemented by occasional teleconferences.

- [Email lists](#email);
- [wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/);
- [Coga GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/coga/);
- IRC discussion on the [#coga](irc://irc.w3.org/coga) IRCchannel, used largely for minute-taking;
- [Web-Based Surveys (WBS)](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/67703/);
- Teleconferences of the task force (also see [meeting minutes](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/minutes));
- Face to face meetings;

These tools are used by participants of the Task Force. For ways non-participants can contribute, see how to [participate in the Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/participate/) and [file comments](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/comments/).

### Meeting Minutes

[Minutes from previous meetings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/minutes) are available.

### Mailing Lists

The Coga TF uses the public-cognitive-a11y-tf@w3.org mailing list ([mailing list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cognitive-a11y-tf/)) for email discussion; members of the public can post to this list to send input to the task force. The TF uses the public-cognitive-a11y-tf@w3.org mailing list [mailing list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cognitive-a11y-tf/) for administrative discussion that is specific to participants in the task force. Participants are automatically subscribed to these mailing lists when they become a participant of the Task Force.

## Current Work

Current Task Force work includes:

- Develop proposed [Success Criteria for WCAG 2.1](https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ACOGA);
- Develop [Cognitive Accessibility User Research](https://w3c.github.io/coga/user-research/) to serve as a repository of related research into cognition and disabilities;
- Develop [Issue Papers for the The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force](https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/) as a use case repository to describe different cognitive disabilities and scenarios for how persons with atypical ability profiles use technology successfully or unsuccessfully;
- Develop [Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/coga/gap-analysis/);
- Identify related work inside and outside of the W3C;
- Review existing techniques and propose new features where needed;
- Gather information on different related technologies and techniques including where techniques in support of cognitive and learning disabled users may conflict with what is needed for other users;
- Make predictions of where technology is headed;
- Identify stakeholders, from whom the task force can solicit ongoing feedback;
- Document business cases and identify areas of resistance, risks and opportunities.

### Work Statement

**[Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force Work Statement](/about/groups/task-forces/coga/work-statement/)** defines the initial objective, scope, approach, and participation of the Task Force.

### Participation

To join the Cognitive A11Y TF, individuals must be participants of either the [Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/) or the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](/about/groups/agwg/). Participants are expected to actively contribute to the work of the Task Force, including:

- Minimum 4 hours per week of Cognitive A11Y TF work (this time also counts towards the individual's participation requirement in the sponsoring WG through which they have joined);
- Remain current on the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force mailing list and respond in a timely manner to postings;
- Participate in Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force telephone meetings, or send regrets to the Task Force mailing list.

If you are interested in participating in the COGA TF, please send e-mail to: [Ruoxi (Roy) Ran](mailto:roy@w3.org) and include a little bit about what you’re interested in and how you think that you may be able to contribute to the Task Force.
