## About the Low Vision Accessibility Task Force

The Low Vision Accessibility Task Force (LVTF) was created as a task force of the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](/about/groups/agwg/) and the [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/). The UAWG has closed.

The objective of the Task Force is to address web accessibility issues specific to people with low vision. Task Force work includes:

- Document accessibility requirements/needs for people with low vision
- Identify gaps between user needs and existing requirements in [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), [UAAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag), [ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag)
- Document sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures for WCAG 2 related to low vision
- Develop supplemental guidance to address low vision beyond WCAG 2
- Contribute to WCAG 3 requirements and guidance related to low vision
- Potentially refine [user agent use cases](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/) for low vision
- Develop support materials to explain the issues and implementation of the above resources effectively
