No announcements at the moment.

## WAI-Adapt Overview

[WAI-Adapt Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/adapt/) provides an overview of the overall WAI-Adapt technique in W3C.

## WAI-Adapt Video

There is also a short [WAI-Adapt technical video](https://ln.sync.com/dl/04f8c9330/6wk4ff4v-77wd78s5-ge6wc24s-vm3iwxwm) available, it demonstrates a semantic overlay approach to enable user driven personalization, eg. the association of user-preferred symbols with elements having those WAI-Adapt semantics.

## Meetings and Communication

The WAI-Adapt Task Force conducts its work using a variety of synchronous and asynchronous tools. This section provides details about:

- Teleconferences of the Working Group and its task forces (also see [meeting minutes](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/adapt/minutes));
- Face to face meetings;
- [Email lists](/about/groups/task-forces/adapt/#mailing-lists);
- IRC discussion on the [#adapt](irc://irc.w3.org/adapt) IRC channel, used largely for minute-taking;
- [WAI-Adapt source repository](https://github.com/w3c/adapt/);
- [Wiki](https://github.com/w3c/adapt/wiki);
- [Web-Based Surveys (WBS)](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/101569/);
- [WAI-Adapt source repository issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/adapt/issues).

These tools are used by participants of the Task Force. For ways non-participants can contribute, see [how to contribute to the Working Group and file comments](/about/groups/apawg/contribute/).

- [WAI-Adapt: Content Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-content/) (Working Draft specification) is the technical specification that provides terms authors can use to enhance web content with information about controls, symbols, and user interface elements.
- [WAI-Adapt: Help and Support Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-help/) (Working Draft) lists examples of the personalized help and support properties.
