## Announcements and Meetings

No announcements at the moment.

## Approach
The WCAG 2.x Backlog TF is a Task Force of the AG WG, which has oversight over the Task Force to ensure accurate interpretation and representation of WCAG 2.x. The AG WG decision process applies within the group. We have an AG WG co-chair liaison to ensure draft content is taken to the AG WG for review as it progresses.

The WCAG 2.x Backlog TF has developed a [workflow process](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/wiki/WCAG-2-Task-Force-process) for both creating and vetting pull requests and creating responses to issues. The process also includes a two-week review of all changes by the AG WG.

## Communication

* [Publicly archived mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wcag2-issues/);
