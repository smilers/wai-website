There are a number of ways non-participants in the APA WG can contribute to the work. If you wish to be an active contributer, however, you should [join the Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/participate/).

## Public comments

The APA WG accepts public comments on publications on the [public-apa](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-apa/) list. This is primarily used for input on formal publications.

## Github issues and pull requests

Much of the technical work is done in the [W3C APA WG repository on GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/apa/). A [GitHub account](http://github.com/) is required for the following functionality. In addition to using the comments list described above to submit input, you may:

- [Watch the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/);
- [File issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/);
- Submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Mailing list discussions

If you would like to monitor the work of the APA WG and contribute on-line, you may subscribe to the following mailing lists. You will not be considered a formal participant but may comment and contribute. The APA WG uses the following mailing lists:

- The [WAI Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/) and its mailing lists is used for announcements of WG activity and to coordinate specification review.
- [public-apa@w3.org](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-apa/) is used for technical discussion of the WG.
- [public-apa-admin@w3.org](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-apa-admin/) is used for administrative coordination of the WG.
