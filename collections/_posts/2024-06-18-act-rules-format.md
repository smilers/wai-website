[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.1/) Working Draft is available for review. The ACT Rules Format defines a format for writing accessibility test rules. It helps developers of automated testing tools and manual testing methodologies to write, share, and implement test rules. The test rules contribute to consistent testing for accessibility standards compliance. Changes from ACT Rules Format 1.0 include: new secondary accessibility requirements and allowing subjective applicability statements. For an introduction to ACT resources, see the [ACT Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/). Please submit any comments by 18 August 2024.
