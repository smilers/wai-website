&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
The Portuguese observatory.

00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:10.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, Jorge, do you want to
introduce yourself briefly

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
and then
please get started.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And you are muted.

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:30.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES:
Sorry.

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:35.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Because the button changed
the position of the mic.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Let me also put
my camera to see me.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Hi, everyone.

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'm Jorge Fernandes from
the Portuguese Agency, the

00:00:55.166 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
AMA, Administrative
Modernization Agency.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:05.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We are responsible for the
monitorization in Portugal

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
of the web accessibility.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
We are the body
responsible for that.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
We belong to the Ministry
of the Modernization of

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
State and Public
Administration.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:23.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And, well, I'm working in
the field of web accessibility

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:30.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
since 1999, so in the
beginning of the WCAG 1.0.

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:34.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
And I'm here to present
you the Portuguese observatory.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I think I can
continue now, Shadi?

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:50.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
In the -- sorry.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:02:01.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I will try to get the
connection with my slides.

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:02.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
Next one.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:10.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So in the Portuguese
legislation, we have

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:16.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
explicitly a method of
evaluation mentioned based

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:21.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
in the simplified
method of the directive.

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:27.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
In the preamble of the
Implementation Act about

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:34.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
monitoring, I
underlined these two ideas.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:39.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
The monitoring should
raise awareness and

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:45.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
encourage learning in
Member States, and the

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:49.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
overall results of the
monitoring activities

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
should be made
publicly available.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:03:01.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
These must involve all entities,
all public sector bodies.

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:08.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And the monitoring is not
an external exercise to them.

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So it's something that they
need to do it by theirselves.

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That is one of the reasons
why we in Portugal abide

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:29.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
the centralized model
of evaluation, a method

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
of three steps to
each entity evaluate.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:40.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
The simplified method
based on automatic and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
semi-automatic tools.

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:48.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And in that what we call
an in-depth light is a manual

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
evaluation based on a
checklist that we call the

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
ten critical aspects of
the functional accessibility,

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:04.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
such a kind of
W3C Easy Check.

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:10.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
And, according to our
legislation, this is

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
mandatory, these two
references, these two

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:20.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
methods of evaluation,
and is recommended, also,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
usability tests with
people with disability

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:31.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
with a minimum of one
task, one users' typology

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:42.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
of the European standards,
like, you know, the EN 301 549.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:49.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
About the simplified
method, as you know, in

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:56.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
the Implementing Act, the
page sample needs to have

00:04:56.533 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
a number of pages
appropriate to the

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:05.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
estimated size and
complexity of the website.

00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:10.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
This is the main principle
mentioned in the Directive.

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
In the Portuguese
proposal, the page sample

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:20.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is composed by the home
page plus all pages linked

00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
from the home page.

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:27.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
From the historical
studies in Portugal, we

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
know that this means
about 60 pages per website

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
in public administration.

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:45.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Evaluate with automatic
tools to WCAG 2.1 AA.

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:50.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the public sector body
can use any kind of tool,

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:57.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
but our team will load
all the samples in the

00:05:57.133 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Portuguese observatory,
and all of them is public.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:12.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
All our tools used same
engine, the QualWeb, that

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
already Carlos mentioned.

00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:19.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We have the AccessMonitor.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
That is a tool
that produced a web

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
accessibility
report of one page.

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:29.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
That is also
in our website.

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:35.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the observatory is an
awareness tool with global

00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:33%
statistics of
the entities.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
If the entity want
to know more details,

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
they need MyMonitor.

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:54.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So the observatory don't
give the detail of the

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:58.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
information -- all
information of the sample.

00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:02.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
To do that, the entities
need to have -- to have

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
access to another tool.

00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:06.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
That is the MyMonitor.

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:14.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So we give them the
MyMonitor, and, of course,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
we include our contact
network of people that is

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:22.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
working in the field.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:29.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So the impact of the
ACT Rules in our tools.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:36.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Until now we change 20
of 80 of our tests based

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:40.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
in 13 ACT Rules.

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:47.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Get a more comprehensive
analysis, a post-processing

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
browser analysis, see more
-- at the moment, our tool

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:56.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
see more HTML elements.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:03.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Our tool is also ready to
translate to other languages.

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:09.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
The output is in
EARL and the CSV format.

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:16.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
We can output all the
results in these two formats.

00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:19.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The tools are open source.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
All the source
are in the GitHub.

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:35.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
You can find them at
the amagovpt.github.io/eed.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It is the local where
you found the source code.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So the biggest impact of
the WAI-Tools Project are

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:47.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
in the test rules.

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:54.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Just to mention two examples,
the headings and the images

00:08:54.899 --> 00:09:01.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
that we already spoke
in this presentation today.

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:05.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Well, talking about the
headings, in the past we

00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:12.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
have headings as
traditional H1 to H6.

00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:14.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
We detect that.

00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:18.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Now we detect more
headings because we have

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:23.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
the traditional ones
and the new ones that

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
I mention here
has an ARIA-like.

00:09:29.566 --> 00:09:34.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
We have the attribute role
heading in conjunction with

00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:39.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the attribute level
with 1 to 6 and maybe more

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:42.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
headings with more levels.

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
So all of them at the
moment are detected by our tool.

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:57.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
About the images, in the
past, we only analyzed the

00:09:57.433 --> 00:10:00.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
alt of the images.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now we have four different
attributes where we can

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:11.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
put also the alternative
text, the ARIA-labelledby, the

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:18.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
ARIA-label, the alt, and also
when we use the title alone.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:29.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If you want to try all the
ACT Rules that we have at

00:10:29.366 --> 00:10:34.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
the moment, you can check
-- you can check the QualWeb.

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:47.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
That is in
qualweb.di.fc.ul.pt.

00:10:47.433 --> 00:10:53.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
So qualweb.di.fc.ul.pt.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:11:04.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And there you can try all
the 67 -- 67 rules that we

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
have at the moment
from the branch of 70.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
So let's try a demo
of the observatory.

00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:20.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
And now is the moment
of David Attenborough.

00:11:20.366 --> 00:11:24.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
I will put
running a video.

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:26.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
Let me try.

00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES:
Let's try a demo

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:32.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
of the observatory.

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:35.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
The observatory is
organized from the big

00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:40.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
picture until the
drill down of one entity.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So the first page of
the observatory have

00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:44.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
the big picture.

00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:48.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Global score from 1 to 10.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Ten is a good practice.

00:11:50.566 --> 00:11:53.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Total number of
categories, total number

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
of websites, pages,
a ranking table of the

00:11:57.933 --> 00:12:03.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
categories with the number
of pages conformed by level.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
We started by
entering the 308 Portuguese

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:12.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
municipalities with the
sample home page plus all

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
pages linked
to the home page.

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
We have more than 50,000
pages introduced at the moment.

00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:31.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
We have data graphics as
histogram of scores and

00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:33.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
the ten most
frequent errors.

00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:48.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Let's go now to a
category, for example, the

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
category of the
municipalities.

00:12:51.433 --> 00:12:55.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Second level, the level of
category or directory, in

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
this case, the
municipalities.

00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:02.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
The same organization of
the first level with the

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
score, the statistical
graphics, the total number

00:13:06.766 --> 00:13:11.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of websites, the
ranking table of entities.

00:13:11.966 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Let's see the
municipality of Murca.

00:13:15.566 --> 00:13:20.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The average score of 9.9,
the total number of pages,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:27.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
243, three pages
conform with level A, and 226

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
pages conform with AAA.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
It's a good one.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Let's see the Murca
municipality in detail

00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
in the third level.

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:40.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
Again, the same
organization of data.

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:46.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Histogram, the ten most
frequent errors, the top

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:51.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
five errors by conformity
level, an accessibility

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
plot in a radar graphic.

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:57.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
The more full the
circumference is, the better.

00:14:01.566 --> 00:14:05.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And a table with
detailed error distribution.

00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:08.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Work in progress.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
An observatory with more
info and with a new look.

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:19.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
The evolution of page
conformity on the left graphic,

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:23.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the accessibility
plot on the right.

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
The histogram of scores.

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:35.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
The bad practices, but
also the board of good

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:40.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
practices with the better
practices by WCAG level.

00:14:47.233 --> 00:14:50.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And, also, the detailed
distribution of all the

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
better practices found.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:03.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
Let's try a demo
of the observatory.

00:15:07.266 --> 00:15:09.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES:
And now I have also a

00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:14.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
demonstration of our
accessibility statement

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:19.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
that is made based
on -- in the WAI-Tools

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
accessibility statement.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:30.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
We have a crawler to pass
through all websites of

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:37.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the public administration,
and we can collect information

00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:43.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
about the
conformity level of the --

00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:49.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that is mentioned in the
accessibility statement.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:55.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And our goal is to collect
all the information because

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
our accessibility
statement is machine

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
readable, so it is
possible with a crawler to

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
get this
information automatically.

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:12.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And I will show you also
what we can also do with

00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:17.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
the machine-readable
reading, for example, an

00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
accessibility statement
already published and use

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:27.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
it to create my
accessibility statement.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Let's see another demo.

00:16:30.966 --> 00:16:32.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES:
A demo of the Portuguese

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
statement generator.

00:16:35.566 --> 00:16:39.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Technically the
Portuguese generator is based

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:43.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
on the WAI-Tools generator.

00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:50.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Imagine that you are
navigating in the ePortugal,

00:16:50.733 --> 00:16:54.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
the citizen
portal of Portugal.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And you want to found
the accessibility statement.

00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:04.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You know that if you use
the suffix "accessibility"

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
in the URL, "acessibilidade"
in Portuguese, it is supposed

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
to find the
accessibility statement.

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:20.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And here it is, the
accessibility statement,

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with the references of the
analysis done, following

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
the model of the directive
and the Portuguese legislation.

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:33.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
At the bottom of all
statements, we found a

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
link to the
generator used to do it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
My goal is to create the
accessibility statement

00:17:42.566 --> 00:17:44.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
to my website.

00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
I can use the
button "upload by URL."

00:17:48.966 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
I can create my
accessibility statement based

00:17:53.566 --> 00:17:56.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
on the one of ePortugal.

00:17:56.433 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I enter the URL of
ePortugal statement page,

00:18:00.566 --> 00:18:04.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I press OK, and is done.

00:18:04.966 --> 00:18:08.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And I have the form
with all the data of the

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
ePortugal
accessibility statement.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now I change the data
according to my organization

00:18:16.866 --> 00:18:22.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and website, press the
button "Preview and Download,"

00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
and the statement is
already with my data.

00:18:26.266 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Well, more or less,
because in this demo I

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:35.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
only change one field,
the name of the organization.

00:18:35.433 --> 00:18:38.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Then I press the
button "Download HTML."

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:48.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
I got the HTML format.

00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Only the structure of the
document, not the styles.

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:57.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
I copy paste this
HTML code to my website.

00:18:57.633 --> 00:19:01.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And when I did that, my
accessibility statement

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
got the style of my site,
and everything is in place.

00:19:08.966 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And we got another
accessibility statement

00:19:12.066 --> 00:19:19.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
machine readable, in this
case, based on the ePortugal.

00:19:19.233 --> 00:19:29.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES:
Okay, so a demo of the

00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:32.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Portuguese
statement generator again.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
At the moment, we --
with the crawler, it is

00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
possible from data from
today we know that we have

00:19:43.466 --> 00:19:47.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
32 accessibility statements.

00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:52.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
We do 16 compliant, eight
partially compliant, and

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
eight no compliant is
some of the data that it

00:19:57.599 --> 00:20:01.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
is possible to get
automatically from the

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
accessibility statement.

00:20:05.166 --> 00:20:10.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So if you want to see
live the Portuguese

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:16.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
observatory, you
can use the URL

00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:21.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
observatorio.acessibilidade.
gov.pt.

00:20:21.233 --> 00:20:29.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So observatorio,
O-B-S-E-R-V-A-T-O-R-I-O.

00:20:29.299 --> 00:20:34.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And that's it
for my presentation.

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:36.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Thank you very much.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thank you, Jorge.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Yeah, so, actually, we
have a question right away.

00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
The question is --

00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:46.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES:
Don't say.

00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:49.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
Yes.

00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:50.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
If we want to install the

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:56.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
testing service to our own
server, do we need -- oop,

00:20:56.799 --> 00:21:02.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I moved -- do we need
the QualWeb core in GitHub

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:08.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
only, or what is the
purpose of the monitor-service,

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:13.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
et cetera, repos
in ama.gov.pt repos?

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So this is a bit of
a technical question.

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES: Yeah,
maybe Carlos can help me.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
About the installation of this.

00:21:19.566 --> 00:21:21.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Somebody wants
to use it locally.

00:21:21.233 --> 00:21:22.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
Carlos?

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:23.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE:
Yeah, sure.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
I can help, definitely.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:32.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
You don't need to install
any QualWeb-related service

00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:36.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
to have the observatory
and the tools in the

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:39.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
observatory
ecosystem working.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
The monitor server that
you mentioned in that

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:49.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
question includes
the QualWeb core.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So everything that
requires an accessibility

00:21:54.066 --> 00:21:57.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
evaluation is handled
through the monitor

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
server, which is also
tasked with translating

00:22:01.966 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
the outcomes of QualWeb
into the formats that the

00:22:07.566 --> 00:22:11.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
tools in the PT
observatory ecosystem use.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So everything that you
need to have your own copy

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
of this ecosystem
is available from the

AMA GitHub repository.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Right.

00:22:25.933 --> 00:22:28.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So that's one particular
aspect is that this entire

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:31.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
observatory and all the
tools are completely open

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
source, and I'm sure they
welcome contributions as well.

00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:40.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
Now, Jorge, another
question was: I don't

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:43.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
understand why a new
accessibility statement

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
can be made by copying a
published -- an existing

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:49.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
accessibility statement.

00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:51.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Can you please clarify?

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:53.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES:
Yeah, you know, one of the

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
things in the -- when
you need to fulfill the

00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:04.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
accessibility statement
is to understand what is in

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
different parts
of the statement.

00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:17.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So when you can visualize
a final declaration already

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:23.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
full field, we know
that this help also to

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
adapt and to fulfill
our own declaration.

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:35.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So it's something that it
is helpful to do that, and

00:23:35.533 --> 00:23:39.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it is also when
you already have the

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
declaration in your
website and want to do

00:23:43.466 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
changes, you need -- you
also can use the same method

00:23:49.566 --> 00:23:54.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that I used here in
the demo to make changes

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
of your own declaration.

00:23:58.766 --> 00:24:03.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
So it is a question
of it's more easier to

00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
understand how to fulfill
the new declaration and

00:24:11.566 --> 00:24:17.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
also help to modify
our own declaration.
