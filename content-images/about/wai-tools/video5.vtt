&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE:
All right.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:12.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So as Shadi mentioned, earlier
in the project we tried to

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:19.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
think of ways that we could
use all the data that might

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
come out of tools that
implementation rules and other

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
open data formats, and it was
one of our goals to propose a

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:33.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
prototype that could show how
we could browse the large

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:38.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
amounts of accessibility
testing data that might become

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
available in such a future.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So for this, we tried to look
at this from the perspective

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of someone that's responsible
for monitoring efforts, and so

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we asked ourselves: How can we
leverage the support of open

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:04.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
data for those
monitoring bodies?

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
And we came up with
this prototype, and

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
we emphasize this.

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It is a prototype.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
It's not something that's
production ready, but we

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
developed this as a way to
support future explorations of

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
what can such a tool offer.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:34.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So let me start by addressing
what types of data did we

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
consider for this prototype.

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So to begin with, we need to
get data from somewhere, and

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
we can see there
are two sources.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
First, the accessibility
evaluation reports that we

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
have been listening to.

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:56.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So these evaluation reports
are written using EARL so that

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
we can import them.

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:05.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So something that's an output
of an Axe evaluation and Alfa

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:09.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
evaluation or a QualWeb
evaluation, all tools that can

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:13.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
output their evaluation
reports in EARL we could

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
import that to this browser.

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And, second, all the
accessibility statements.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:26.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
We included statements that
use the open format, both the

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
one that Eric just presented
and that was developed as part

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
of the project, but also
the one that we adapted

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
to be used in Portugal.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
And from both of these
sources, we collect an

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
interesting variety of data.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:48.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So we extract from these
sources data on success

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
criteria, on the elements that
have been assessed on the ACT

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:59.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
rules that were used to check
if the tool uses ACT rules,

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:02.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
the assertions that
were made, and the outcomes

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of those assertions.

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so that we can browse
this, we have also added the

00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
five -- a set of metadata that
can be used to categorize and

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
support this evaluation data.

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:19.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So here we can see the
continent, country, the

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
category of the website or
the mobile app owner.

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:28.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So if it's a private or a
public entity, the sector

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
where the entity operates in,
and even what evaluation tool

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
it was used to
produce the report.

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:47.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And we in the tool designed
a number of visualizations.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So you will be able to see --
we'll do a short

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
demo after the slide.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So most data is presented
using bar charts with -- that

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
are grouped by the assertions
or the success criteria.

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:08.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
We -- besides the bar
charts, we have a table.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We provide access to a table
with the equivalent data of

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:17.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the bar charts, but we made an
effort so that all the charts

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:23.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
are keyboard navigable, and we
also include a timeline view

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
so that it's easier to get
this grasping of how the

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:31.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
different metrics have
evolved over time.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And I think it's best to
illustrate the different ways

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:43.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
that we can interact with
the demo, with the data, by

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
showing you a demo.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:56.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So let me switch to
new -- a new window.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:01.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And so now this is the -- the
initial page that you access

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
when you enter this tool.

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:19.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Here we have -- let me
start with a disclaimer.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
All the data that's being
presented in this demo was

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
randomly generated, including
the name of websites and the

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
evaluation tools,
so everything has

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
been randomly generated.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the volume of data that we
have here is representative of

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the number of evaluations that
a country the size of Portugal

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:44.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
can expect to have in
their monitoring process.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So as I was saying, this is
the initial visualization.

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:58.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You get a chart grouped by
pages that have been evaluated

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
over different continents.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
We start at the
continent level.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
You can include information
about the assertions, the

00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
passed assertions, the failed
assertions, the ones that the

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:18.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
tool can't tell if they
have passed or failed,

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
the inapplicable ones,
and the untested ones.

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:26.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So similar to what Eric
just showed previously.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
You can, instead of showing
assertions, show the

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
information based
on success criteria.

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:37.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So passed, fail,
can't tell, inapplicable,

00:06:37.933 --> 00:06:41.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
and untested criteria.

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:48.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And let me go back to
assertions and move this Zoom

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:55.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
window to another place
and show you the data table

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:58.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
that we have.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Basically, the same data that
you have in the bar charts can

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:06.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
be presented in
the tabular format.

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:07.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So if you want to see data
grouped by country, you just

00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:15.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
pick that on that sidebar.

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:19.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And now that's -- instead
of just seeing, okay, like,

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
seeing everything on the
sector page, I just want to

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:27.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
know information about the
two -- the testability of the

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:29.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
private and public
sectors in the British

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:31.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Indian Ocean territory.

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:38.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So I just select that bar, and
I can drill down on sector

00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:44.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
information on the model
window that shows up.

00:07:44.766 --> 00:07:52.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And now I have the information
about just the British Indian

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:57.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Ocean territory grouped by
private sector and public

00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
sector, and I
can compare that.

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:04.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So if I want to see all
data about sectors, I can

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
just press there.

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:10.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I see, okay, I have over
4,000 pages on the private

00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:16.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
sector and over 3,000
pages on the public sector.

00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:22.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And now let's say I want to
compare data of the public

00:08:22.466 --> 00:08:24.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
sector onto
specific countries.

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:31.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So instead of drilling down, I
want to group by this -- a way

00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:34.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
to group this kind of data
using another category and,

00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:39.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
say, okay, let me group
this, for instance,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
France and Luxembourg.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:49.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So I can now see the data on
public sector bodies only.

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:53.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So we're comparing sector
public grouped by two

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
countries, France
and Luxembourg.

00:08:56.033 --> 00:09:01.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And in this visualization
I can have them both at

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
the same time.

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:06.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
Let me move
to another class.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
Let me see.

00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:10.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We can see tags or categories.

00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:14.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Here we have, once
again, randomized data.

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:20.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Don't forget if I want to see
how health -- how the health

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
sector has been doing over
time, I can just, once again,

00:09:24.733 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
select this on the bar charts.

00:09:30.066 --> 00:09:31.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Sorry.

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then I can go and do
-- and select the timeline

00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:40.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
option, which will show me
for every month that I have

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
collected data on this -- on
websites or mobile apps that

00:09:48.766 --> 00:09:55.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
have been tagged as health,
I can see the data here.

00:09:55.366 --> 00:10:00.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Let me go back to tag and show
you how I can compare, for

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
instance, data on the health
and the media sector.

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:08.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So here I can use the
comparison and health, which

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:11.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
is the one that I've
selected it already.

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:12.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Previously selected.

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:16.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And now I can also select
media, and the comparison page

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
will show me, okay, the number
of pages that have been

00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:22.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
evaluated and the passed
assertions, failed assertions,

00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
can't tell assertions,
inapplicable, and untested

00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:28.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
assertions for both sectors
side by side so that I

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
can compare them.

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
Let me just present
one more feature.

00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:39.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
If I go -- this is
specific at this level.

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If I go to the application
website and I change my

00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:48.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
visualization from the
assertions to the success

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
criteria, now I can have
access to specific tests of

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:57.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
each success criteria
for one application.

00:10:57.533 --> 00:11:04.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So we can see here for the
front applications of the fair

00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
success criteria, and I'm
going to select here this

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
application or
website, whatever.

00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:13.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And I have this -- it's only
in this view that I have this

00:11:13.866 --> 00:11:16.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
option here, the
Details option.

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So if I go to the Details
page, now I have -- okay, for

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:23.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
this application or website, I
know that passed the success

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:27.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
criteria, and I can see the
different tests that tell me

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:31.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
that, and I see that it
failed this success criteria.

00:11:31.433 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And, once again, I have
access to the different

00:11:33.566 --> 00:11:35.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
tests where it fails.

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:42.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So we can, in fact, go all the
way up from a grouping of the

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:51.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
data by continent to specific
assertions of one application.

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:57.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So this shows us the range
that we can have just by

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:03.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
visualizing data that's made
available from this --

00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:05.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
from these tools.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:10.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So let me go back to the
slides and just -- I've

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
finished my presentation.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So all of this is open source.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You can play with this demo.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
It's available at

00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:37.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
www.qualweb.di.fc.ul.pt/
placm/test.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The source code will be really
soon available at this rep.

00:12:42.933 --> 00:12:44.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's not there yet because
we're moving this to a

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:50.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
dedicated repository for
this -- for these tools.

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:58.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So you will be able to find it
at GitHub.com/carlosapaduarte.

00:12:58.866 --> 00:12:59.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
That's --

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
C-A-R-L-O-S-A-P-A-D-U-A-R-T-E/pl
acm. Okay?

00:13:10.066 --> 00:13:13.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And if you have any questions
or any problems getting this

00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:17.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
to run, you can get
in touch with me at

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:24.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
caduarte@campus.ul.pt.

00:13:24.633 --> 00:13:26.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
And thank you.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
I think I've gone a
little bit over my time.

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Sorry for that, Shadi.

00:13:31.766 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: No.
You're spot on.

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Thank you, Carlos.

00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:38.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And as I told folks earlier
on, this is a bit more

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
aspirational part.

00:13:40.233 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So just to recap, we looked
at, you know, in the morning

00:13:45.066 --> 00:13:49.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
of these many, many small
rules, right, that test very,

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:51.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
very specific parts.

00:13:51.933 --> 00:13:54.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And we looked at
so-called implementation

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:56.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
reports for these.

00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:58.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
So how do we collect
information from these

00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:00.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
different rules and
the tools and the

00:14:00.866 --> 00:14:02.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
methodologies implemented?

00:14:02.933 --> 00:14:07.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then if we can aggregate
that on a, say, monitoring

00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:11.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
body level or, you know, even
more widely, can we collect

00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:15.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
all this data, all
this information?

00:14:15.633 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I understand this seems a
bit more futuristic, but,

00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:22.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
you know, why not
think about that.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Public websites are
required to be public.

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:29.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The monitoring of their
reports is required to happen.

00:14:29.866 --> 00:14:33.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
If we can provide this open
data, we can look more -- and

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
this is not about
shaming people.

00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:38.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
This is about analyzing where
are there issues, which

00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:43.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
particular sectors need more
support, need more training

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:48.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and advocation, and, you know,
member states or countries or

00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
even organizations.

00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:54.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It could be on an organization
level could use that to

00:14:55.033 --> 00:15:00.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
improve their actions and what
they're doing to make sure

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
accessibility is implemented.

00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:05.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So the key word here
is EARL, the evaluation

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and report language.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:13.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
This is a format to write
down test results, basically.

00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:18.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'll read out the GitHub URL
for that, where you can go and

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:22.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
see that syntax for
writing such results.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:31.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So it's github.com/w3c/earl,
E-A-R-L,

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:35.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Evaluation And Report Language.

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:36.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:39.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
We had a question
for you, Carlos.

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
My master's student is
studying the Portuguese public

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
libraries website
accessibility.

00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:47.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He has full list of public
libraries' addresses.

00:15:47.866 --> 00:15:51.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Can he import the list to test
data browser and do a summary

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:53.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
analysis of all of them?

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE: No. No.

00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:03.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Because this, too, does not do
the accessibility evaluation.

00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:10.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
If you have the accessibility
evaluation of all of those

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:15.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
libraries in EARL format, as
Shadi was just mentioning,

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:23.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
yes, then you can import those
reports and use this tool to

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:27.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
go over and do the --
what kind of analysis that

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
you want to do.
