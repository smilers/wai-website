&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
So, let's move directly

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
to our first session
on the development of

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Accessibility
Conformance Testing rules.

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:12.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I want to ask on the
virtual stage, Wilco Fiers

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:19.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
from Deque and Kasper Isager
from Siteimprove and Carlos

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:24.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Duarte - Carlos Duarte
from University of Lisbon.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
If the three of you could
just briefly - Wilco can

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
you say a few words about
yourself, just introduce

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
yourself to the audience.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
I sure can.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
Can you guys
hear me alright?

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Yep, all fine.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
Fantastic.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Alright, so my
name is Wilco Fiers.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I work for Deque Systems.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I am a product owner
and project manager.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
There, I am responsible
for Axe-core which is Deque's

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:52.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
open source accessibility
engine which Shadi mentioned.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
In addition to that,
I spend part of my time

00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:58.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
on W3C activities.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:04.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I am the chair of the ACT
Rules Community Group, a

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:08.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
facilitator on the ACT
Task Force, as well as a

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
member of the Silver
Task Force which is

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
currently developing WCAG 3.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thank you, Wilco.

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And all these groups that
Wilco mentioned, the task

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
force and community
group and so on, will

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
be explained in
this presentation.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
Don't worry about.

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
We'll get it.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
We'll get to it.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
We'll get there.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Piece by piece.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
We love acronyms in W3C.

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS: I have
too many hats also, to be fair.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Kasper,
please introduce yourself.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; KASPER ISAGER:
Yes, I will make it short.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I don't have as many hats.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
My name is Kasper Isager
and I work as the product

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
owner of Alfa
at Siteimprove.

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
And then Alfa is
our accessibility

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
conformance test engine.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Welcome.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:01.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
Well, you don't
need to be so humble.

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:05.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Kasper is a mastermind of
a lot of the accessibility

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
engines at
Siteimprove as far as I know.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE:
Hi, I'm Carlos Duarte.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I teach - well my main
responsibility is to teach

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:23.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
computer science at the
University of Lisbon, although

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
my research is focused a
lot on web accessibility.

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:31.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so, as part of my
responsibilities in teaching

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
computer science, I also
teach web accessibility to my

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:40.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
students and I also
have some more hats.

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:46.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Together with Wilco,
I'm co-chairing the ACT

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Community Group and also
another hat for the W3C

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
where I do work for the
Education and Outreach

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:59.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Working Group, specifically
on preparing the new - the

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:02.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
curricula, the new web
accessibility curricula.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thank you, Carlos.

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And Wilco, go ahead.

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Take it away please
with the presentation.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:19.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
And this time
you are muted.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
I should unmute.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:22.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Do you mind going
to the next slide?

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Thank you very much.

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:35.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So, I just wanted to get into
the goals of ACT really quick.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
Again, ACT stands
for Accessibility

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Conformance Testing.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
The project wasn't
setup as part of WAI-Tools.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
It predates it
by several years.

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:51.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Some of you may also know
it as Auto-WCAG which is a

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:57.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
group that later got
renamed to the ACT Rules Group.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And the reason that
group was started off is to

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
improve consistency in
accessibility testing.

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:10.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, one of the greater
challenges Shadi mentioned

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
is consistent testing.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:17.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
You do want, when you
get a report from somebody,

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:22.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
for that report to be
accurate and based on

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
well-founded ideas.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:29.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Otherwise, you might
fix something and you have

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
somebody else take a look at
it and they find more things.

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:35.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Or they may find
completely contradicting

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
things which can be
fairly frustrating.

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:44.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
If you don't have a clear
definition of when your

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
project is sufficiently
accessible, that makes

00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:51.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
life pretty hard.

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
This kind of gets
exacerbated when you look

00:04:58.066 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
at something like European
Union which is starting to

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:07.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
track the accessibility of
government websites across

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
the whole of Europe.

00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:12.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
If Denmark tests things
in a different way than the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Netherlands does, what
you'll end up with is with

00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:20.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
results that don't -
aren't very comparable.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Even worse, you might have
a website that is relevant

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
in multiple countries and
if they used different

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
testing methodologies to
gauge whether or not you

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:33.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
complied with the law -
because that's what we're

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
getting to at a certain
point; it should be legally

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:40.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
required to meet these
standards - if they are

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
testing along different
methods, you may find that

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:49.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
your website complies in one
country but not in the other

00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
even though you're testing
along the same WCAG standard.

00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:56.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So, that's really the
issue and the problem

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:57.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
isn't too extreme.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Like, it's not like WCAG
is all over the place and

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
results go anywhere.

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:11.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
But there are differences
there and it kind of erodes

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
the trust that you can
get from results like that.

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:20.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So, that is what
ACT was setup to do.

00:06:20.633 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And our goal there is, as
I mentioned, we started

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:29.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
first off with Auto-WCAG
which is really focused on

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
doing this for automation.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:35.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
But then we broadened
it out to address testing

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
methodologies as well.

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:40.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And testing methodology
is not a well-established

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
term but if you ask
around in accessibility

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
institutions around the
world, most of them have

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:52.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
some sort of document that
tells you how to interpret

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:55.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
WCAG, like what you do
with this particular element

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
on a page and with that
particular element on a page.

00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:04.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
One of the great things
about the kind of accessibility

00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:11.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
guidelines is that it was
written in a way that it is

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
technology agnostic so that
it can live for a long time,

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:18.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so that it isn't just
applicable to one particular

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
version of the web standards,
but it should be applicable

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
to all of them.

00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:26.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
But that also means there
is some vagueness there

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that does require
that interpretation.

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:33.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So those interpretations,
those are what we are

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:38.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
trying to capture with the
ACT Rules and so this is

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:42.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
applicable really to lots
and lots of organizations.

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:44.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Next slide please.

00:07:49.866 --> 00:07:53.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, we've developed this
rules format, the ACT Rules

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Format, and the benefits
of that are fairly wide.

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:04.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So, like I mentioned,
we've been working with

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
this format for
several years now.

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:09.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That is really the goal
of this project, is to use

00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:12.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the rules format and
develop these rules.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And it has really improved
the quality of the organizations

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:21.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that have adopted this,
like in noticeable ways things

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
have gotten
more consistent.

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:27.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
That has been between the
project partners but also

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
organizations outside of
the WAI-Tools Project that

00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:35.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
have been using the ACT
Rules to make their tools,

00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:38.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to make their testing
methodologies more consistent.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, we are seeing
concrete evidence that this

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
approach seems
to be working.

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:52.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
By writing these rules,
we then have a more

00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:57.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
authoritative set of
things that we know are

00:08:57.833 --> 00:09:02.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
conforming to WCAG or are
not conforming to WCAG and

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:06.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
what we've ended up doing
is to share these rules

00:09:06.466 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
with the W3C and to
have those published.

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:12.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
There are currently eleven
of the rules that have been

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:15.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
developed, that have
been published by the W3C.

00:09:15.466 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So, these are really
validated by the people

00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:21.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that wrote the standard.

00:09:21.633 --> 00:09:24.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, this gives us a lot
more credibility as well

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:25.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
for the work
that we've done.

00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:29.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is the way you're
supposed to interpret WCAG

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
for the HTML standard
or for SVG documents.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:38.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
And by doing this, we
resolve a lot of open

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
questions for WCAG.

00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:49.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
One example of such a
question is if you have an

00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:53.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
image with the text right
next to it and the image

00:09:53.966 --> 00:09:58.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
basically says the same as
the text, does that image

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
need to have a text
alternative or not?

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:05.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
It's kind of a
debated question.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
Some accessibility
experts say yes, some

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:10.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
accessibility experts say
no, you absolutely should

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
not do that, and the rules
answer this question for us

00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:18.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
definitively so we do
not have to have these

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
conversations anymore.

00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:25.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It clears things
up in a lot of ways.

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And by clearing this up,
we enable organizations to

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:36.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
test more consistently,
which - allows accessibility

00:10:36.733 --> 00:10:39.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
results to be
more widely trusted.

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:43.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
You can trust that one
organization using ACT

00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:49.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Rules will produce almost
identical results to another

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
organization using
those same sets of rules.

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:55.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
There can still be
small differences but the

00:10:55.366 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
differences are far smaller
than what they used to be.

00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:01.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Next slide please.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, just to get into
some of the things that you

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
get from ACT Rules.

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think I might have been
going over time already,

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
so I'll keep that quick.

00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:23.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, ACT Rules use
unambiguous language which

00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:25.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
is great because it
helps you answer things

00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:28.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
in a very precise way.

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:33.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
If you need to know what
something means, how to

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:36.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
interpret a thing,
the ACT Rules offer a

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
very precise description.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:45.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
So there's no more, well, it
depends kind of thing going on.

00:11:45.233 --> 00:11:48.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
ACT Rules are very clear
on when something should

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
pass and when
something should fail.

00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:57.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
ACT Rules also document
assistive technologies.

00:11:57.866 --> 00:12:03.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If something doesn't work
in some screen readers but

00:12:04.033 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
it does in others, you
can find that information

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
in the rules and this
helps you frame how to

00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:12.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
understand the results.

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:15.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, in some cases you may
still see an issue if you

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
try something with a
particular screen reader

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:22.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that you don't
see in the report.

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:24.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
That really helps
you understand what the

00:12:24.933 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
results actually mean.

00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:30.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
Then they
document assumptions.

00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, if there are very
unlikely edge cases or if

00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there's a particular
interpretation that may be

00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:47.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
controversial or that is
unusual, then that will be

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
documented in the
rule itself so you will

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:54.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
understand why is the
result the way it is and

00:12:54.466 --> 00:12:59.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that really helps you
frame the results again.

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And then lastly but not
least important either,

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:08.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
diagnostic for
tools and methodologies.

00:13:08.233 --> 00:13:12.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
We want ACT Rules to
be something that can be

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:17.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
implemented irrespective
of whether or not you're

00:13:17.299 --> 00:13:20.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
doing it manually or
if you're automating.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
That really
shouldn't matter.

00:13:23.966 --> 00:13:26.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
It shouldn't matter if
you're using a particular

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:31.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
technology stack in your tool
or some other technology stack.

00:13:31.866 --> 00:13:34.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
These are written in
a way that everybody is

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
doing accessibility testing.

00:13:36.866 --> 00:13:39.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Whether it be fully
automated or completely

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:42.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
manual or somewhere in
between, you should be

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
able to implement these.

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:50.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
I think with that, I am
passing it on to Kasper.

00:13:50.233 --> 00:13:53.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; KASPER ISAGER:
Alrighty.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, I will just briefly
talk about the rules that

00:13:57.066 --> 00:14:00.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
we developed as part of
the project and then also

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:04.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
briefly touch on how these
were actually developed.

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:09.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, just for an overview,
we initially set out to

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:13.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
develop a total of seventy
of these ACT Rules, of

00:14:13.433 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
which we wanted thirty
to be fully automatable,

00:14:16.566 --> 00:14:18.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
twenty-five of them were
to be semi-automatable,

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:23.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and fifteen were to be
completely manual rules.

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:27.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And we started out by
trying to cover as much

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:31.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
crowd as possible in
terms of the type of content

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that the rules dealt with.

00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:35.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, we were looking at
the text content, graphics,

00:14:35.866 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
audio/visual media, all
the stuff that was really

00:14:40.066 --> 00:14:44.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
based on, in many cases,
the existing rulesets that

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
the individual project
partners already had

00:14:47.066 --> 00:14:49.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
implemented in
their individual tools.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then later on as the
project progressed, we started

00:14:53.166 --> 00:14:55.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
seeing more and more
specialized rules focused

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
on increasingly narrow
aspects of their content.

00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:01.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
We started looking at
stuff like orientational

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
arcs implemented using
CSS and also things like CSS

00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
declarations that couldn't
be overwritten by the users.

00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, much more specialized
failure cases than the

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:19.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
stuff that we
initially covered.

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:21.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
We also ended up
developing several rules

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:26.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that didn't relate
directly to the WCAG but

00:15:26.233 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
we are looking at things
like WAI-ARIA conformance

00:15:29.266 --> 00:15:32.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and also its associated
authoring practices that

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
define best practices
for use of WAI-ARIA.

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:39.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And with that, I
will cue the next slide.

00:15:43.466 --> 00:15:44.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:47.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, as already mentioned,
these rules were developed

00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:51.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
in an open W3C Community
Group, and within that

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
group the first thing we
of course had to decide,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
also among the project
partners, were which rules

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:59.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
we actually
wanted to develop.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And for this, we had
a list of a defined

00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:05.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
selection criteria so we
would look at things like,

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:10.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
so, a proposed rule for
example or how many new

00:16:10.566 --> 00:16:12.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
additional success
criteria from the WCAG

00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:15.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
does it cover that we haven't
already covered, and what is

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
the, sort of the options both
across the project partners

00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:23.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and how easy would it be
to implement in our tools,

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:26.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and also how likely was
it that this was a rule that

00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:29.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
would be picked
up by the community.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then once we had
selected rules to develop,

00:16:33.233 --> 00:16:36.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
we would incubate them in
this open community group

00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:39.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
with input both from the
project partners but also

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:40.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
the wider community.

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:42.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And this is really when
the bulk of the work was

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:46.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
spent, with the biggest
and most important point

00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:49.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
probably being
reaching a consensus on

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:53.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
interpretation of whatever
success criteria it was

00:16:53.633 --> 00:16:56.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
that the rule is
supposed to test and also

00:16:56.833 --> 00:16:59.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
researching, like, the
real world implications of

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
what the rule would look
at, figuring out so under

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:06.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
what assumptions would the
thing that the rule looked

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:09.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
at actually be a problem.

00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And in case those
assumptions didn't hold,

00:17:11.266 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
then would there actually
be an actual problem?

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:19.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So, really finding out
where, you know, theory

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
and reality aligned
and agreeing on an

00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:25.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
interpretation that will
then form the basis of the

00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:27.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
rules that we developed.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And once we had the
rules developed, they were

00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:32.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
implemented by the project
partners in our various

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
tools and also validated
by another project partner

00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:39.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
on this fixed set of
real web pages that we

00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:42.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
had selected beforehand.

00:17:42.733 --> 00:17:47.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And then once implemented
and validated and matured

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the community, we would
ship them off to the ACT

00:17:50.866 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Task Force to eventually
be included as official

00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
live resources
on the WAI webpage.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
And with that, I will
pass it on to Carlos.

00:18:08.533 --> 00:18:10.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE:
Thank you, Kasper.

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:15.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
I'm going to start by
talking a bit about how

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:18.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
does this
impact you, okay.

00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:23.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, what does it mean
for you, for the community,

00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:27.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that we have
developed seventy rules?

00:18:27.933 --> 00:18:33.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, first it means that we
now have more than seventy

00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
different aspects about WCAG
that at least three different

00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:40.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
organizations agree on
how they need to be tested.

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:44.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Okay, so I think this is
already very significant.

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
And when I say at
least three different

00:18:47.466 --> 00:18:51.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
organizations, I'm not
saying three different

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
project partners, and
this is something that

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Kasper just talked about.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, because the main work
we've done in this project

00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:02.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
was done in the scope of
the ACT Community Group,

00:19:02.233 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which means that it was
an open group and its work

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:07.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
was publicly available.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So, we are not
just three project

00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
partners reaching consensus.

00:19:12.366 --> 00:19:15.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
It's wider than that.

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:19.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And there were involvement
at different levels from

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
these organizations
outside the project that

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
fortunately was not
just at the rule writing

00:19:24.633 --> 00:19:25.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and reviewing level.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, not surprisingly, the
project partners included

00:19:30.266 --> 00:19:34.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in their products, the ACT
Rules that we were developing.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
But I think we can say that
we are really happy to see

00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that other organizations
started to do the same.

00:19:41.566 --> 00:19:45.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, the other two vendors
have now products that

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
include conformance
testing using ACT Rules,

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
manual testing
methodologies that also

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
include ACT Rules.

00:19:57.233 --> 00:20:01.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, from this you can
understand that ACT Rules

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:05.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
already have an impact on
several tools, on several

00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:09.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
methodologies, and let me
stress this out again, not

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
only from the tools
and methodologies made

00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:16.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
available by the
project partners.

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, if you use one of
these tools or if you have

00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:23.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
your projects checked
with one of those

00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
methodologies, then
ACT Rules have already

00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
impacted you, and we can
also say - you will be

00:20:32.766 --> 00:20:36.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
able to hear about this
in the next presentation -

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:40.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
that these tools and
these methodologies are being

00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:43.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
used by monitoring
bodies across Europe.

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, we are already
witnessing the impact of

00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:51.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
ACT Rules at
a large scale.

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:54.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
And we believe that
ACT Rules will play an

00:20:54.366 --> 00:20:57.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
important role for the
European monitoring

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:59.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
efforts as Wilco said.

00:20:59.666 --> 00:21:03.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, given the consistency
that the ACT Rules offer,

00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
even when monitoring
agencies from different

00:21:06.466 --> 00:21:09.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
countries use different
tools, if those tools

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
implement ACT Rules,
then their results can be

00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:16.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
compared with a higher
degree of confidence.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We think this is already a
great start but in the future,

00:21:21.433 --> 00:21:24.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
we can only hope that the
impact will be even bigger.

00:21:24.933 --> 00:21:28.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, as also Wilco
mentioned, eleven of the

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ACT Rules developed by the
project and adopted by the

00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:35.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
community have already
been published by the W3C.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
There are more in the
pipeline that should soon

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
increase this number and I
think that the interest in

00:21:44.766 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ACT Rules is only bound
to grow when the community

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:51.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
starts finding
ACT Rules elsewhere.

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:54.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Shadi, can you move to
the next slide, please?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
Thanks.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, you have a screenshot,
so a sneak peek at the

00:22:03.933 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Understanding document for
WCAG 2.2 soon to be released.

00:22:12.566 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And you can find there -
yes, thanks, Shadi - a new

00:22:17.566 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
section on Understanding
ACT Rules and we have this

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:24.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
section at the same level
that we have currently for

00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:28.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the Understanding Techniques
for WCAG's success criteria.

00:22:28.166 --> 00:22:31.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, this is really
exciting and we are really

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
seeing ACT Rules being
adopted and promoted.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Okay, so now I want to
talk to you about how you

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
can contribute to
keep ACT Rules going on.

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, we like to believe
that this was a successful

00:22:48.566 --> 00:22:53.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
project and that we really
kickstarted the work on

00:22:53.233 --> 00:22:55.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
ACT Rules but now it's up
to you, to the community

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
to keep this
momentum going.

00:22:57.566 --> 00:23:01.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
And fortunately, there
are many ways in which

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:02.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
you can contribute.

00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:05.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
For instance, if you are
a tool or a methodology

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
developer, you can
start by checking how well

00:23:09.066 --> 00:23:12.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
aligned your project is
to the current consensus

00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:15.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
expressed in ACT Rules.

00:23:15.133 --> 00:23:17.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So you can read the rules
that are related to the

00:23:17.666 --> 00:23:19.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
checks that you support.

00:23:19.433 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You can see how well you do
on the published test cases.

00:23:24.266 --> 00:23:27.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And you don't agree with
some aspect of the rule?

00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Great.

00:23:29.066 --> 00:23:32.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We did try our best but
we know we are not flawless.

00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:35.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, raise an issue
reporting what you found

00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:39.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and it will be discussed
in the community and the

00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
rule will be
updated if needed.

00:23:41.266 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
It wouldn't be
the first time.

00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:47.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
While you are at it,
you can send us the

00:23:47.633 --> 00:23:50.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
implementation reports of
your tools and methodologies.

00:23:50.833 --> 00:23:53.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
In the ACT Rules website,
we have a section for

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:56.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
implementations where
all reports that we

00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:58.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
receive are displayed.

00:23:58.366 --> 00:24:01.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, this is a great way
to let the community know

00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:04.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
that your products are
supported by ACT Rules.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And irrespectively of
your developing tools or

00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:12.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
methodologies or being a
user of such or a monitoring

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
body or someone
that's responsible for

00:24:16.366 --> 00:24:19.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
publishing accessible
information on the web, be

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:23.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
happy because there are
other ways you can help.

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:25.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
We are always looking for more
people to help reviewing rules.

00:24:25.833 --> 00:24:28.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
So, it's great to have
people with different

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:31.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
experience and perspectives
contributing to this work.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
If you have an idea for
a rule, you can write it.

00:24:34.766 --> 00:24:37.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Don't worry if
you feel overwhelmed

00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:38.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
about writing a rule.

00:24:38.933 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
You can team up with
others and do it as a

00:24:41.266 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
collaborative project.

00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
That's what we are all
doing here, collaborating

00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:48.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
to make the web
more accessible.

00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And to do any of this,
you don't have to be a W3C

00:24:52.466 --> 00:24:56.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
member, but if you are or
want to become one, then

00:24:56.533 --> 00:24:58.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
you can actively
contribute to support the

00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
adoption of more rules
into WCAG 2.2 and potentially

00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:07.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
the new WCAG 3.

00:25:07.533 --> 00:25:11.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, Shadi, I think we
can move to the final slide.

00:25:11.433 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And you can find more
details about ACT Rules

00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:20.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
and how you can
join this community

00:25:20.533 --> 00:25:28.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
at act-rules.github.io.

00:25:28.599 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And thanks for listening
and I think Shadi, now you

00:25:32.566 --> 00:25:35.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
want to take some
questions, right?

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:37.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Yes,
questions are coming in.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Thank you, everybody who
is contributing questions.

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:44.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If you have questions, now
is the time in the Q&amp;A function.

00:25:44.133 --> 00:25:46.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Before we get to that,
just to get a little bit

00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:53.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of a feel, how many people
are subscribed to the

00:25:53.766 --> 00:25:56.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
community group and
roughly how many are

00:25:56.833 --> 00:26:02.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
active in the calls and,
you know, the active part

00:26:02.533 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
of the work, not
just subscribed?

00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:08.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
Who wants to
take that question?

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
I'll take it.

00:26:09.966 --> 00:26:13.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
It depends a little bit
because there are two

00:26:13.966 --> 00:26:19.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
groups, one in W3C itself
and a Community Group which

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
has no official standing at
the W3C but is hosted by it.

00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:28.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
The Community Group has,
I believe, around ninety

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:31.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
members right now.

00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:35.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
As for active
participants, again that

00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
depends on how
active you mean active.

00:26:37.633 --> 00:26:42.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think right now we have
ten to twelve people that

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:49.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
regularly attend meetings
like every month, every

00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:53.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
twice a month,
something like that.

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:55.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
There's a whole bunch of
people that are slightly

00:26:55.966 --> 00:27:01.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
less active but that
still regularly contribute.

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:04.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
As a rule comes up that
they are interested in,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
they'll drop a review.

00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
That happens quite a
lot and I frequently get

00:27:09.066 --> 00:27:12.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
surprised by new people
who have come out of

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
nowhere and
submitted some information.

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:18.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thanks.

00:27:18.099 --> 00:27:19.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Yeah, I just wanted to
give a little bit of an

00:27:19.099 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
idea and people are, as
you were saying, Wilco,

00:27:22.466 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
participating
in different ways.

00:27:24.066 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Some people are attending
the calls and discussing things.

00:27:26.566 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Others completely
asynchronously, they are

00:27:29.266 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
using the GitHub platform.

00:27:33.766 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS: Yeah,
it's - it takes relatively

00:27:37.466 --> 00:27:39.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
little time for
anybody to participate.

00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You can spend as little
or as much time as you want.

00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:46.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I do also think it's worth
mentioning that just from

00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:49.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
the people that have
joined over the last year

00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
maybe, year and half, I
frequently hear that they

00:27:54.066 --> 00:27:58.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
join and they find it a lot
of fun and they learn a lot.

00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:01.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
It is a group where you
get to learn quite a lot

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:04.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
of in-depth accessibility.

00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:07.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, if you're interested
in the nitty gritty details

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:09.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
of accessibility,
this is really a good

00:28:09.266 --> 00:28:11.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
group for you
to participate in.

00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:13.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Great.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, one of the questions
that we have is - I'll

00:28:16.733 --> 00:28:20.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
read it aloud - WCAG is
supposed to be interpreted

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:23.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
to be relevant in
different contexts.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In one country, users
might be using older assistive

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
technology for example and
it would be relevant to use

00:28:28.866 --> 00:28:31.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
all the techniques
to meet the requirement.

00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:33.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Then in a country where
all users have the latest

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
versions of assistive
technology, in practice it

00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
means a solution that is
good enough in Germany for

00:28:41.466 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
example, might not be good
enough in Italy for example.

00:28:45.466 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
And that is fine.

00:28:46.566 --> 00:28:49.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, how do the ACT Rules
take this into account?

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
Silence?

00:28:56.599 --> 00:28:58.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
You want to pick somebody?

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:01.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I mean I can answer all
of them if you want, but.

00:29:01.133 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Go ahead.

00:29:02.466 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS: Okay, so,
it's a really good question.

00:29:06.466 --> 00:29:07.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:11.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
How do ACT Rules
deal with that?

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
ACT Rules have an
accessibility support

00:29:13.866 --> 00:29:18.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
section, so if we know
about these differences,

00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
we will mention
them in that section.

00:29:21.466 --> 00:29:24.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You can find information
about things that may work

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
slightly differently
depending on which

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
technology you were using.

00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:32.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That information is
documented in the rule and

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:37.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
if you happen to know any
that isn't, please open an

00:29:37.366 --> 00:29:38.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
issue and we will add it.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
It belongs in
those documents.

00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:45.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
I also think it's
worth mentioning those

00:29:45.299 --> 00:29:47.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
differences aren't
that big anymore.

00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:53.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
The types of assistive
technologies that people

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:57.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
are using tend to
be international ones.

00:29:57.233 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
There are only a handful
of big players out there,

00:30:00.566 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
so the differences
really aren't that big

00:30:03.766 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
anymore these days.

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
What does matter a little
bit is whether or not you

00:30:11.766 --> 00:30:14.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
exclude some of them.

00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, for example, if you
want to exclude a common

00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:21.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
screen reader on the Mac,
you might have slightly

00:30:21.866 --> 00:30:26.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
different tasks then if
you wanted to include those.

00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:30.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The rule documents this
kind of information for you.

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:39.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That freedom is
available within the rule.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thank you.

00:30:39.866 --> 00:30:41.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Kasper, I think
this one is for you.

00:30:41.866 --> 00:30:46.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So, do ACT Rules only
cover accessibility tests that

00:30:46.133 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
can be semi-automated
or fully automated?

00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:54.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Or are there also
rules that clarify rather

00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:58.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
subjective WCAG criteria
like 2.4.6, adding the

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
label that needs to
be manually evaluated?

00:31:03.733 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; KASPER ISAGER:
You know, I can definitely

00:31:05.066 --> 00:31:05.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
provide an answer to that.

00:31:05.966 --> 00:31:09.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And the answer is yes,
we also have affordances

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:10.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
for manual rules.

00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:15.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
I also mentioned we
did set out to implement

00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:19.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
fifteen fully manual
rules, so rules that could

00:31:19.299 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
not reasonably be
implemented in automated

00:31:22.466 --> 00:31:25.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
tools but could be
implemented as part of

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:27.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
manual test methodologies.

00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:30.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
I would say, the manual
rules are slightly more

00:31:30.666 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
difficult in the sense
that you still have to

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
follow the ACT Rules
from it, of course.

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And the ACT Rules from it
are fairly strict on what

00:31:39.766 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
kind of rules you
all have to write.

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:45.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
One of the big things
is that the applicability

00:31:45.599 --> 00:31:48.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
section of the rules for
the description of what

00:31:48.533 --> 00:31:51.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
kinds of content the rule
applies to has to be both

00:31:51.866 --> 00:31:54.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
completely
unambiguous and objective.

00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:57.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
And for some of the
success criteria, the

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
objectiveness criteria
is really difficult to

00:32:01.966 --> 00:32:04.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
meet, it has proved.

00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:09.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So, yes, you can author
manual rules using the

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ACT Rules format.

00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:13.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
But it may be slightly
more difficult that you

00:32:13.466 --> 00:32:15.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
still have to
remain objective in the

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:18.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
applicability section
of the rule and that's

00:32:18.266 --> 00:32:21.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
difficult to do with some
of the more, I would say,

00:32:21.533 --> 00:32:23.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
subjective WCAG
success criteria.

00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:29.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Right, but that's - I

00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:31.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
think an important
- thank you, Kasper.

00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:33.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think that's an
important question because

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:35.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
it also came up in the
questions that people

00:32:35.533 --> 00:32:37.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
asked in the
registration form.

00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:41.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think a lot of people
think about when they hear

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
rules, they automatically
think of automated tools

00:32:44.466 --> 00:32:46.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
only and I think here
it's really important to

00:32:46.866 --> 00:32:50.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
emphasize that these
apply to both manual and not -

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in fact, actually, we
have several rules that we

00:32:53.266 --> 00:32:56.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
created as part of the
project that relate to

00:32:56.366 --> 00:32:59.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that specific success
criteria on headings and

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:02.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
we have others on labels.

00:33:05.866 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So, yes - it is done
and we also have manual

00:33:10.966 --> 00:33:18.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
methodology developers who
have been implementing these

00:33:18.433 --> 00:33:21.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
rules in their methodology,
comparing their methodology.

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:24.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Speaking of, this is a
question that also came up

00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:27.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
in the registration form.

00:33:27.666 --> 00:33:29.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
Carlos, maybe
this is for you.

00:33:29.866 --> 00:33:34.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, somebody wants to
create an implementation

00:33:34.666 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
report for their tool
or for their methodology.

00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:39.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
How do they do that?

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:41.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Can you first explain what
an implementation report

00:33:41.933 --> 00:33:44.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is and then how they
actually do that, how they

00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:46.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
provide such information?

00:33:46.433 --> 00:33:50.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE:
Yeah, sure.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, perhaps I need to
start by providing a bit

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of context on what's inside
an ACT Rule and specifically

00:33:58.299 --> 00:34:02.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
an ACT Rule besides
having an applicability and

00:34:02.133 --> 00:34:05.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
expectation as
a set of examples.

00:34:05.333 --> 00:34:11.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Some of them are examples
of elements, documents,

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:16.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
pages that meet the
criteria and so pass the rules.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Some of them are failed
examples and some of them

00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
are examples of pieces of
code that are inapplicable

00:34:23.566 --> 00:34:25.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
for that rule.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, what we expect to
have in an implementation

00:34:29.633 --> 00:34:34.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
report is how well does
your implementation fair

00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:36.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
against those examples?

00:34:36.266 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So, does it pass
the test examples?

00:34:39.966 --> 00:34:42.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
Does it fail the
failed examples?

00:34:42.533 --> 00:34:46.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And does it not consider
the inapplicable examples

00:34:46.866 --> 00:34:48.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
of such a rule?

00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So, an implementation
report is basically a

00:34:51.566 --> 00:34:57.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
report of the outcomes of
your implementation for the

00:34:57.199 --> 00:35:03.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
different test cases that
are described in an ACT Rule.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
How can you submit one and
how can you prepare one?

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:14.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, we expect your reports
to be provided using EARL.

00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:20.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
The Evaluation And Report
Language, serialized in JSON-LD.

00:35:20.133 --> 00:35:23.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, if you do provide us
that, we can import that

00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:28.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
into our website and
display it together with

00:35:28.266 --> 00:35:33.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
the current displayed
implementation reports.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
We have a section on
the website, so if you go

00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:41.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
online to the website,
there's a section dedicated

00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:43.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
specifically to
implementations and there

00:35:43.233 --> 00:35:44.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
are instructions
there on how you can

00:35:44.766 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
submit an implementation.

00:35:48.866 --> 00:35:53.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And we have some tools
that you can use to help

00:35:53.166 --> 00:35:56.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
you prepare an
implementation report.

00:35:56.233 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
We have all the test cases
for all the rules accessible.

00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:04.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, it can help you
prepare for implementation.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
If you have some
problems setting up an

00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:10.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
infrastructure for
preparing implementation,

00:36:10.766 --> 00:36:14.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
do reach out to us and we
should be able to assist

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:17.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
you in that,
in your project.

00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thank you, Carlos.

00:36:22.466 --> 00:36:26.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
While I have you on
the line, we're kind of

00:36:26.133 --> 00:36:27.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
running out of time.

00:36:27.166 --> 00:36:28.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There are more questions
coming so we might need to

00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:32.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
push some of these
towards the end of the

00:36:32.733 --> 00:36:35.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
day just to move on.

00:36:35.566 --> 00:36:38.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
But I think, maybe
briefly, Carlos, this one

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
it says, can you give a
concrete example of the

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
rule on should we have
alt text in an image if the

00:36:49.633 --> 00:36:53.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
text that is next to
the image is the same?

00:36:53.133 --> 00:36:55.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
I think it would help
to understand how you

00:36:55.766 --> 00:36:56.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
choose a specific rule.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think here, if you can
explain the test cases in

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
the context here that are
part of the rules to help

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
you understand what the
rule actually refers to.

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:19.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE: Wilco
you seem to have the rules

00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:21.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
in your head
better than I.

00:37:21.633 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Which - this is definitely
coming from the example

00:37:24.966 --> 00:37:26.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that you gave in
your presentation.

00:37:26.866 --> 00:37:29.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Can you point me -?

00:37:29.699 --> 00:37:30.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Sorry, we don't actually

00:37:31.033 --> 00:37:31.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
have the time
to go into this.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; CARLOS DUARTE:
Okay.

00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:34.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: We
could come back to this later.

00:37:34.633 --> 00:37:36.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So maybe let me summarize.

00:37:36.766 --> 00:37:42.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, the point is that
this rule, there would be a

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
rule that is talking
about, let's say text

00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:50.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
alternatives for images
and these will consider

00:37:50.133 --> 00:37:53.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
different techniques and
the examples, the test

00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:57.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
cases in the rule would
have an example when what

00:37:57.733 --> 00:38:01.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
happens if there is a
description next to the image.

00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:04.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
What in that case, what
the alt text should be?

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So, if we were to write
the rule for a good alt

00:38:07.533 --> 00:38:12.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
text, so the rule that we
have right now only checks

00:38:12.933 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
for alt text
whether it exists or not.

00:38:16.466 --> 00:38:18.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And if we would have a
rule that checks how good

00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:20.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
an alt text is, it would
be - we would have tests

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
cases where we would
have different types of

00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:30.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
situations and so that
people could compare test

00:38:30.233 --> 00:38:31.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
cases towards that.

00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:34.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Again, we could come
back to this later on.

00:38:34.366 --> 00:38:38.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We are kind of running
out of time but one of the

00:38:38.933 --> 00:38:47.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
things that was asked
is, do rules cover all

00:38:47.933 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
of the success criteria?

00:38:49.066 --> 00:38:54.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Or will the work
continue to cover everything?

00:38:57.533 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Who wants to
take that one?

00:38:59.866 --> 00:39:01.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
I'll go.

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:05.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, we haven't completed
all the success criteria.

00:39:05.699 --> 00:39:10.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
I don't know if we ever
will fully complete

00:39:10.966 --> 00:39:12.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
everything but we
certainly intend to

00:39:12.966 --> 00:39:16.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
continue to go
on with this work.

00:39:16.533 --> 00:39:20.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
WAI-Tools Project is over
but the ACT work is not.

00:39:20.366 --> 00:39:24.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
This is going to be, you
know, ongoing projects to

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
continue to
extend the coverage.

00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:32.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Some of the things not
currently done is so - our

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:37.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
main focus has been on HTML
where it sees it as an SVG.

00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:41.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
There are definitely
still gaps in those,

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:44.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
specifically the things
that are difficult to

00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:46.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
automate, but beyond
that, there are other

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
technologies to
consider as well.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There are currently no
rules for PDF for example.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
That is certainly a
thing that I would love

00:39:53.333 --> 00:39:55.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
to see us develop.

00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:59.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, there's definitely
more work and it is also

00:39:59.966 --> 00:40:03.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
good to mention that this
is an ongoing process.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
As technology develops,
as the HTML standard

00:40:07.766 --> 00:40:11.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
develops, as assistive
technologies develop,

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
these rules will
continually get updated.

00:40:14.566 --> 00:40:17.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, unlike WCAG, these
rules are an ongoing thing

00:40:17.699 --> 00:40:21.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
that need to be maintained
so this work is never going

00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:23.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
to end and I'm going
to continue doing this

00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:28.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
until I retire, so.

00:40:28.233 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Yeah, I like to use the

00:40:29.866 --> 00:40:33.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
metaphor of snowballs,
especially now in winter for

00:40:33.666 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
many of us, so snowballing,
and I think this project

00:40:37.066 --> 00:40:40.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
started the snowball with
seventy rules and now it's

00:40:40.366 --> 00:40:43.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
really, as Carlos was
saying, now it's up to you the

00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:46.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
community to
help continue that.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Speaking of, Wilco,
while I have you on the

00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:50.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
line, there was
a question for you.

00:40:50.433 --> 00:40:52.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
This might be a
misunderstanding.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Can you talk about how
authoritative the ACT

00:40:57.266 --> 00:41:00.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Rules are versus the
WCAG success criteria?

00:41:00.766 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What is the normative part
and what is informative?

00:41:03.866 --> 00:41:05.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; WILCO FIERS:
That's a fantastic question.

00:41:06.033 --> 00:41:11.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, the WCAG success
criteria are published by

00:41:11.766 --> 00:41:14.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
the W3C as a
Recommendation.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:17.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
They've gone through
an extensive process of

00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:21.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
public reviews by
the W3C and they are

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:24.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
an internationally
recognized standard.

00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:28.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So, those are
solid as anything.

00:41:28.966 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ACT Rules are
written by smaller groups.

00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:41.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They go through a less
involved process of review

00:41:41.433 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and they get published
still by the W3C but not

00:41:47.566 --> 00:41:49.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
by the whole of the W3C.

00:41:49.433 --> 00:41:55.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
There is no massive
W3C-wide review but there

00:41:55.166 --> 00:41:58.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
is a review and an
approval that comes from

00:41:58.099 --> 00:42:00.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
the Accessibility
Guidelines Working Group

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
which are the
authors of WCAG.

00:42:05.066 --> 00:42:09.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, you can see them as
these are rules published

00:42:09.433 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
by the authors of WCAG,
whereas WCAG itself is

00:42:13.366 --> 00:42:16.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
published by the W3C as
a standards organization

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
as a whole, so.

00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:20.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thanks.

00:42:20.933 --> 00:42:22.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
We call these -
internally we call

00:42:22.266 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
them supporting documents.

00:42:23.966 --> 00:42:27.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
These are the so-called
Techniques documents, the

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Understanding documents
- Understanding WCAG 2.

00:42:30.166 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
So, with every success
criteria, there is a

00:42:32.066 --> 00:42:35.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
document associated with
it called Understanding

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Success Criteria XYZ that
explains more background

00:42:40.733 --> 00:42:42.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
and would help and so on.

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:44.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Then there are several
Techniques, how you can

00:42:44.633 --> 00:42:48.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
meet that requirement,
and now we also have tests

00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:50.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
associated with
success criteria.

00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:54.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
These supporting documents
are informative, so they're

00:42:54.366 --> 00:42:57.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
not normative like the
success criteria themselves.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
That is what you have
to meet but these are all -

00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:03.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
all these supporting
documents help you make

00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:05.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
sure that you meet
the requirements.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Good.

00:43:06.766 --> 00:43:08.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
I will take the liberty
of answering two more

00:43:08.699 --> 00:43:10.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
questions and
then we'll move on.

00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:14.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
One question was
when will WCAG 2.2, when

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:15.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
will it be released?

00:43:16.033 --> 00:43:18.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
That was a teaser from
you, Carlos, because you

00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:19.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
mentioned that
in your slides.

00:43:19.466 --> 00:43:23.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Currently, it's planned
for mid-2021, so mid this

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
year we expect the new
version of WCAG 2.2, and

00:43:26.866 --> 00:43:30.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
hopefully with as many
test rules as possible as

00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:32.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
part of the
supporting documents.

00:43:32.666 --> 00:43:35.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And then there was
another really good question.

00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:38.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
When can we expect -
can we expect the WCAG 3

00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:43.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
guidelines to follow the
same approach as ACT Rules

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
so WCAG 3 success
criteria can be tested more

00:43:46.199 --> 00:43:49.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
objectively with
automation where relevant?

00:43:49.533 --> 00:43:52.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is a really good
question because just this

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
- just last week on
Thursday, fresh, hot off

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the press, we, the W3C,
published the first public

00:44:01.533 --> 00:44:04.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
draft of WCAG 3.0.

00:44:04.199 --> 00:44:07.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
This is still a very,
very early draft and we

00:44:07.466 --> 00:44:08.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
would love your comments.

00:44:08.566 --> 00:44:11.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
We, of course, want
to make WCAG 3.0 more

00:44:11.766 --> 00:44:15.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
testable and so we
want to look at as much

00:44:15.766 --> 00:44:18.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
approaches, as much
carry-over as possible

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
of the ACT Rules.

00:44:20.066 --> 00:44:25.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
At the same time, WCAG 3 has
a very new conformance model.

00:44:25.066 --> 00:44:28.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So, they are looking
at different ways of

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
evaluating, so not just
binary but maybe on a scale.

00:44:33.699 --> 00:44:36.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is maybe a topic for
another webinar about WCAG

00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:41.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
3.0 but the thing is, yes,
we are working closely to

00:44:41.733 --> 00:44:44.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
try to get - improve
the testing in future

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
versions of WCAG.
