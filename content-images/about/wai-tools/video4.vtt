&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: For the
reporting support tools, I

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
would like to call
Eric Velleman from the

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Accessibility Foundation to
come to the virtual stage.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:12.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Eric, please introduce
yourself and take it

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
away from here.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Okay.
So, hi.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
I'm Eric Velleman.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And let me first start up
here on my desktop here.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So I hope you all see this.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:32.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
That should be it.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
So I'm Eric Velleman.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm from the -- I work at
the Accessibility Foundation

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
in the Netherlands.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:46.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We worked on the ACT
Rules and on the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
reporting support tools.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So I'll be presenting
the two tools that we

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
worked on recently.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
Both tools are
undergoing an update.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And in this short -- the two
short presentations that will

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
follow now, I'll show you
what the updated tools

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
will look like.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And probably -- and I hope
you can see them soon

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
on the W3C website.

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:19.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So first the
WCAG-EM Report Tool.

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:23.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So it used to be the --
does everybody see this?

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Yeah,
we see your screen, Eric.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN:
Okay. Good.

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:33.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So it used to be this left
thing here, which is if you

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
still go to the website, you
will still see this one.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And in the meantime, we've
been working on this one,

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
the one on the right.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So it's the updated version.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:49.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And to get an overview, it
can be found at w3.org/WAI --

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
W-A-I -- /eval/reports -- how
do you call that small line

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
tool -- forward slash.

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:05.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And what we did is we follow
the procedure to evaluate

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:08.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
websites in the
reporting tool.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It helps you generate a
report according to WCAG-EM.

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:14.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
It supports and
links to relevant

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:16.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
information and tools.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
It aligns with the WCAG
conformant claims.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And it supports WCAG
2.0 and WCAG 2.1.

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:27.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It doesn't support WCAG 3 yet.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:30.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And it can also show the
difference between the two.

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So if you had a previous
one in WCAG -- a previous

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:41.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
evaluation in WCAG 2.0, you
can just add -- just only show

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:44.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the WCAG 2.1 success criteria.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It is a manual tool, so it
doesn't do any automated

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:51.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
checks by itself, but it does
have the possibility, the new

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:54.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
version, to import
automated checks.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:03:00.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So if you use Axe or Alfa by
Siteimprove, you can import

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:05.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
the results as long as
they comply with the JSON

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
standard for the import.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It has the possibility to open
and save input, so you can

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:11.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
exchange results.

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:14.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So at the end of an
evaluation, you can sort of

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:18.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
save your evaluation, send it
to a friend, and the friend

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:21.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
can import the evaluation and
continue with it or check it

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:26.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and send it back to you or --
well, in this way you can work

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:31.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with multiple people on an
evaluation as long as you

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:34.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
don't work on it
at the same time.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
It supports and links to
relevant information tools.

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
I think I said that
in the previous slide.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's an easy translation file.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So it used to be rather
complex to translate, but now

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
it's -- it has an easy
translation file, so

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
that makes it easy.

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
There is an English file.

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:55.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
If you translate everything
that is in English to your

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
language, you will have your
own language file or your own

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
language version of
the reporting tool.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It has changed the new WAI
design and framework, and it

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
has the possibility of
importing data from tools

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:11.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
using the EARL format.

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So now let's shift
to the live demo.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
It should be this one.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:23.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So this is the live demo of
the tool that is currently

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:27.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
still on GitHub.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:30.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we are working on it, so
you will see that you have the

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
same walk-through here.

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:36.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So the Overview, Scope,
Explore, Sample, Audit,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Summary, and View Report
are the menu items.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
And it explains you
how the tool works.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
It gives tips for using it.

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
If you go to it, at the right
there's sort of a menu bar.

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:53.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You can view the reports,
start a new evaluation, open

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
an evaluation from a JSON
file, or import data from

00:04:57.066 --> 00:05:01.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
automated evaluation tools.

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:05.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So to start a new evaluation,
you just click the button, and

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:07.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
then you go to the
first page, Scope.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:10.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Well, here you can -- this is
not really different from the

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:16.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
previous version, only that
it also has a WCAG 2.1 and it

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
works a bit better.

00:05:19.466 --> 00:05:23.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It has all the parts that were
in the previous tools except,

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:26.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
of course, the nice
part is this one.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
I should show you the
translation file here.

00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:30.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So I should push Netherlands.

00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:34.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You'll get the Netherlands
version of the tool, which is,

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
of course, great.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
If you want your language
there, you just translate the

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
file, and ask somebody at W3C
to put it in the right folder.

00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:49.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And then all of a sudden, you
will have your own language

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
web accessibility evaluation
report tool generator.

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Here, the sample.

00:05:57.666 --> 00:06:01.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You can audit the selected
sample, which is, like, here

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
with perceivable.

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:09.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You can sort of declare
something as passed, failed,

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:13.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
cannot tell, not present, or
not checked, et cetera, for

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:17.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
all the guidelines
and success criteria.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
You can add information for a
summary, like the name of the

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
evaluator, the evaluation
commissioner, the date,

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:27.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
executive summary.

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:30.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then, finally, you can
sort of view the report.

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Multiple buttons to do that.

00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:34.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And it will generate the
complete report with all the

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
things that you just input
in the previous pages.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And on this page is the
interesting button.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Save the evaluation
data as a JSON file.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So if you click it, you'll see
here at the bottom it saves

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:51.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
an evaluation.json.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And if you go to the first
page, you can then open the

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:56.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
evaluation from JSON.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I won't do that here because
you'll see all the documents

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
on my computer, but
trust me, it works.

00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:05.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
That's the website
accessibility report

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:09.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
generator live.

00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:14.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But, once again,
great translation.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
So you just changed from

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:16.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
English to Dutch.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Thank you, Eric.

00:07:18.766 --> 00:07:23.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So there are already a couple
of questions and just some

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
additional visual description.

00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:30.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
So this is not the
final design of how it

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
will look like.

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:37.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's the kind of tool
Eric had read out the URL.

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:41.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And you can find that URL also
from the project page and from

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the agenda, the report tool.

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're updating it primarily
to support translations more

00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:53.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
easily, but also to put
it in the new WAI style.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Many things here is not going
to be the final way it looks.

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's still a work in progress.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
And so, yeah -- yeah.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:14.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
There's several questions,
Eric, that -- if you can stop

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
moving around because
it's distracting me.

00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Sorry.

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Moving
content is distracting.

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:24.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Oh, sorry.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOUT-ZAHRA: Yeah.

00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So can you clarify the
difference between open and

00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:29.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
importing data?

00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Yeah.
So open is to open a file.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So I just showed you at the
end of the evaluation you can

00:08:40.366 --> 00:08:48.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
save your evaluation report
in the form of a JSON file.

00:08:48.366 --> 00:08:50.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
And somebody else
can open your report.

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So an import, that
is to import data

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
from automated tools.

00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:58.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So like Axe, for instance.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:05.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So you can use a tool to
evaluate a website, and then

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:10.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
the evaluation results
can be imported into the

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:13.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WCAG-EM Report Tool.

00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:18.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
The small angle there is that
the only thing that will be

00:09:18.133 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
imported currently are the
URLs that are in the sample.

00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So it will choose from all the
URLs that you have checked

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
with the automated tools.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:32.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
It will only use the results
of the pages that are in your

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:36.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
sample at the moment.

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:38.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Excellent. Thank you.

00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:42.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then some more technical
questions regarding the

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:45.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
underlying data.

00:09:45.233 --> 00:09:46.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Somebody is concerned.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
The underlying JSON data,
will it stay the same

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:52.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
in the new version?

00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:55.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN:
Yeah, as far as I know.

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:57.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
You know, I'm not
sure about that.

00:09:57.466 --> 00:10:00.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So you mean if you have JSON
data from the previous tool?

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Yeah. No.

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:06.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
The reports you have
so far will stay valid.

00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, yeah, so the
functionality, the importing

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:14.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and the opening and closing
will be the same, and the JSON

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:18.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
format will remain unchanged.

00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:20.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:25.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Another question that came
also in the -- similar

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:28.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
question was on
the registration.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Can you export -- so we can
now export an HTML and in JSON

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
format for machine readable.

00:10:36.766 --> 00:10:39.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Are there other formats,
for example, pdf or Word or

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Excel or something?

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:45.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: No. No.

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:47.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
Just HTML as far
as I know and JSON.

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:48.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Right.

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:52.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We do have GitHub where you
can put wish list requirements

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:53.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
or you can open issues.

00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Also, if you find bugs, please
do report these, and we will

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:03.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
-- yeah, we will see what
we can do in the future.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But right now, yeah, we do
not export to other formats.

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:10.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
There was a question: Can you
show an example of importing

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
an Axe EARL report?

00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So this was about reporting
from -- importing from

00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:17.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
automated tools.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So on -- I think you said
you don't want to show the

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:28.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
files on your computer,
which is fair enough.

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:34.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
I think the best we can do is
there's -- the EARL GitHub --

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:38.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
and I'll give the URL
later to the EARL GitHub.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
I think it should be linked
from the WAI-Tools Project

00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:46.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
page as well, and there --
there should be some sample

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
reports there that you
can use from there.

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:53.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Eric, does the report
generator evaluate web

00:11:56.066 --> 00:11:58.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
or mobile apps?

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:00.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Web.

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:06.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: And it's
WCAG, so it's independent.

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:09.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So, actually, the important
thing is this is not an

00:12:09.933 --> 00:12:14.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
automated tool, so it actually
uses all the criteria, so you

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:20.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
can use it just as well to
create reports for the apps.

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:22.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: At
Accessibility Foundation, we

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:27.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
use the same tool
to evaluate apps.

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:29.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Right. Good.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Good to hear.

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Wow, there's a whole bunch
of questions coming in.

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:35.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
We want to move on.

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:39.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
When this new version
will be released?

00:12:39.533 --> 00:12:41.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That's a really good question.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
We hope in the
coming week or two.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
So please hang on.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
We'll let you know as
quickly as possible.

00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:51.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
At the end of the presentation
today, at the end of the

00:12:52.033 --> 00:12:54.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
session, I'll be giving you
information on how you can

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
receive updates, how you can
be notified, and so we'll let

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:03.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
you know as soon as the
new version is available.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Another question: Austria
and Spain uses the tool from

00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:08.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
monitoring bodies
and make changes.

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:11.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Is there any exchange
between your organizations?

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, yes, we did actually ask
for inputs through GitHub.

00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:24.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I believe we got comments
from Austria, I believe, maybe

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
directly, maybe indirectly.

00:13:26.433 --> 00:13:31.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so, yeah, we developed
this, you know, openly.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Of course, we always love more
input so that we can consider

00:13:35.866 --> 00:13:38.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
any requirements
in future versions.

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Then another question.

00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:46.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Would it be easy to add
non-WCAG criteria to the

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
report generator?

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:51.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
For example, other clauses
from the EN, from the European

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
standard of the directive.

00:13:56.733 --> 00:13:58.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Well, I
mean, if you have a programmer

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:01.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
then I think it
would be easy maybe.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
But it's -- yeah.

00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:04.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
It's open source.

00:14:04.966 --> 00:14:08.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, yeah, you
would be -- yeah. It's --

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:09.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: All on GitHub.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Not out
of the box, but you should be

00:14:11.633 --> 00:14:17.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
able to adapt the -- okay.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And then last question
before we move to your next

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
presentation, Eric.

00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We often have multiple
analysts working on evaluating

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:25.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
a site at the same time.

00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:28.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Is there any way to break out
of a page for evaluation and

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
upload these results back to
the main evaluation so they

00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
could work in tandem so that
somebody -- I understand the

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:38.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
question that somebody
evaluates part and then the

00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:39.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
other evaluates other
parts and then we can

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
combine the reports.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:47.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: No, not if
do you that simultaneously.

00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So if somebody stops
evaluating and another takes

00:14:51.666 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
up, then you can send each
other the JSON file, and the

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:57.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
other one can continue.

00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:01.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
But if you -- as far as I
know, if you both do the

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
evaluation, you
import the file.

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:08.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I'm not quite sure
what happens then.

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
So could be
that it is added.

00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:13.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
Hmm.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
I'll put it on the list
of things to check.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Right. Yeah.

00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And then information in
Germany, we also use the tool

00:15:22.566 --> 00:15:25.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
and make changes, but
we're still at work.

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:30.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So, obviously, using that and
making changes to it, yeah,

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:33.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
welcome to -- we also welcome
translations --

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Yep.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: -- for
all resources that

00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:38.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
you've talked about.

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:40.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There were some questions on
translations that I'll come

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
back to later
again in the Q&amp;A.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:53.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So -- oh, and somebody --
at the moment we add

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:55.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
an Excel converter.

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:58.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So that's nice to hear that
there's something like that.

00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:01.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Again, this is an open-source
project, so you're always

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
welcome to contribute
things back into GitHub if

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:07.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
you wanted to.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
There are several issues in
GitHub of people asking to

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
have, for example, this
collaborative so that multiple

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:17.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
people can edit
at the same time.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:20.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We know that this is a feature
request, but that's actually

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:23.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
quite a project on its own.

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:28.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
For now we started really with
just this import to allow when

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you select a sample of pages
from your site and you have

00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:39.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
automated results, you can
fill in what the tool knows,

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:42.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
but you still need to
continue doing the manual

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
part of your work.

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:49.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
But it helps combine
automated and manual testing.

00:16:49.233 --> 00:16:50.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:16:50.299 --> 00:16:52.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're a bit behind schedule,
Eric, so please go

00:16:52.466 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ahead and continue.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:58.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Okay.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Let me get my
presentation back.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Get you back.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Share screen.

00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:15.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
So there we are.

00:17:15.933 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The accessibility statements.

00:17:17.666 --> 00:17:22.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Well, this is a shorter story
because we did a lot more work

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on the evaluation tool, and
not just adding translation --

00:17:27.766 --> 00:17:30.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
the possibility of easy
translation there, but also

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:35.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
adding a lot of functionality
like the imports and like the

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
saving and opening
files and to be able

00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
to share evaluations.

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:44.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So for the accessibility
statements generator, it is

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
still the version that you can
see live on the W3 website.

00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If you search for statements
generator on W3, you'll

00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
find it immediately.

00:17:53.566 --> 00:18:00.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
It's at W3.org/WAI -- W-A-I
-- /planning/statements

00:18:00.433 --> 00:18:04.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
and slash.

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:07.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And there's a page there to
generate an accessibility

00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
statement with a lot of
information on the Preview

00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:15.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
button, but you still have to
fill in everything by hand.

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:19.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So what the generator does is
it guides you on providing

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
accessibility statements.

00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:25.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
It is aligned with the EU Web
Accessibility Directive and

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:27.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
with WCAG 2
Conformance Claims.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
It is a manual generator,
so this one does not do

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
any automatic checks.

00:18:32.433 --> 00:18:37.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But you could link to the
evaluation reports or to a

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
JSON file, but you output
it from the previous tool.

00:18:42.833 --> 00:18:44.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
The output is available
in both human and

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
machine-readable formats.

00:18:46.266 --> 00:18:49.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
The tool includes examples of
statements, guidance, how to

00:18:49.533 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
make accessibility statements.

00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
Most people are, like,
what is important for

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
people with disabilities?

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
What would they like to see
in a statement like that?

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:59.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
And a statements
generator tool.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It includes input from
communities and experts, and

00:19:02.966 --> 00:19:07.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it is almost ready for
translation to your language

00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:12.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
because we're still working
the last bits of that.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, also, in, like, a week
or two, this should be done.

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then you could just take
one file, translate everything

00:19:20.566 --> 00:19:25.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in that file, and you would
immediately have your language

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
version of the accessibility
statements generator.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
The only thing that has to be
done is that somebody at W3C

00:19:31.933 --> 00:19:37.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
will then have to put the
translated file into a folder.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So why would you provide an
accessibility statement?

00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:45.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, that is to show users
that you care about them and

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
about accessibility, to
provide them with valuable

00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:53.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
help, for CSR reasons, or it
may be a requirement, like in

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Europe for the Directive,
for public sector bodies.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
And what does
the tool then do?

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:04.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Well, the tool asks you the
questions you need to answer.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So it asks you basic
information, your efforts,

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:11.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
technical information about
the accessibility, and

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
regarding the approval
and complaints process.

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:16.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It helps create an
accessibility statement that

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
can be further customized
and branded, et cetera.

00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:25.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So you can just save the end
result and make your very much

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
most -- more beautiful
version out of it.

00:20:28.766 --> 00:20:31.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
It helps make accessibility
statements conformant with

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:33.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
the EU Directive.

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:35.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And the output is not for
lawyers, but for users

00:20:35.866 --> 00:20:38.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
of your content.

00:20:38.099 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So make sure they understand
so they know what to do.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:43.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
That was the idea behind
the accessibility

00:20:43.633 --> 00:20:45.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
statement generator.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:47.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And the future work
is the translations.

00:20:47.633 --> 00:20:49.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
We're working on it now.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
And we also looked into
the possibility to add

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
your own questions.

00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:57.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
That was one of the issues.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So if you go to the GitHub
page, you'll find a lot of

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
proposals there
for changes to the

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:04.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
accessibility statements
generator.

00:21:04.233 --> 00:21:06.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
We had to prioritize.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:10.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So besides a few other things,
the most important thing was

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
the translations.

00:21:12.066 --> 00:21:14.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
But all the code is there.

00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:17.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, also, in this case you
could take the complete code

00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:19.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and add your own questions.

00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I think in the case of
the accessibility statements

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:25.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
generator, that would really
be a fairly simple thing to do.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think even if you're not
really extremely technical

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
you could probably do that.

00:21:31.466 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:21:32.766 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Now for the live demo.

00:21:34.966 --> 00:21:37.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Let me go here.

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:41.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
So this is the live
page on the W3 website.

00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:48.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
And it's at
W3.org/WAI/planning/statements.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then if you go to
/generator and then slash --

00:21:53.266 --> 00:21:57.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
well, then you will get to
this create page, where it

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
asks you basic information
like the name of your

00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:04.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
organization, which could
be like this, and then a

00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:08.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
telephone number or
address of your website.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
That's not a correct one.

00:22:10.133 --> 00:22:13.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Over here the standards
applied, the conformance

00:22:13.233 --> 00:22:16.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
status, the additional
considerations.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Don't send them to me.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Et cetera.

00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:27.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So there's the efforts you
did, like organizational

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
measures you took or any
other measures, you can

00:22:30.966 --> 00:22:33.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
add them here.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:39.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Technical information like the
accessibility limitations,

00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:42.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
compatibility with user
environment, et cetera.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So it's all -- this is
all described in detail.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If you show info here, below
every header or form fields,

00:22:52.299 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there is -- or above every
form field, there is more

00:22:54.966 --> 00:22:59.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
information about what
you could fill in there.

00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:02.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
The technologies
used, et cetera.

00:23:02.166 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Then somewhere at the
bottom you can preview your

00:23:05.066 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
accessibility statement,
and it takes you to your

00:23:07.466 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
accessibility statement.

00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:12.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
So I haven't filled
in anything, so now

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
it's website name.

00:23:14.366 --> 00:23:20.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
But if I would go
back, let's see here.

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:24.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
I will put at least
a name in here.

00:23:24.233 --> 00:23:26.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
Oh, I did put
the name in here.

00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Terrible things of life.

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:40.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Well, here it is.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
So I probably
forgot something.

00:23:43.133 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
It does the description
of the name.

00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:48.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So it's a few forms later.

00:23:48.833 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So it will generate --
everything that you fill out

00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:55.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
will be appearing below here.

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So that is why it is currently
very short, but the more

00:23:58.033 --> 00:24:00.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
information you input, the
more information you get in

00:24:00.866 --> 00:24:04.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
this accessibility statement.

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:07.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
That's it.

00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:10.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And then above here -- of
course, before I say that's

00:24:10.333 --> 00:24:12.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
it, I should have said
somewhere here above you will

00:24:12.833 --> 00:24:17.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
soon see this translation
button where you can get the

00:24:17.433 --> 00:24:21.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
file, translate it to your
language, and then see your

00:24:21.733 --> 00:24:25.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
own language version of this
accessibility statement.

00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:29.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:31.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thank you, Eric.

00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:32.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

00:24:32.533 --> 00:24:33.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
So right on time.

00:24:33.866 --> 00:24:36.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
We have a couple of questions
that I think are a little bit

00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:39.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
beyond the scope of this
project, but they're really

00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
good questions.

00:24:40.466 --> 00:24:43.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
So one question is: I've
seen public sector websites

00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:47.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
publishing accessibility
statements only to conform

00:24:47.433 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
with regulations.

00:24:49.266 --> 00:24:52.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
In those statements they
say that some parts

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:54.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
are not accessible.

00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:57.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
What's the use of
having such statements?

00:24:57.333 --> 00:24:58.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So, yeah, that's a
really good question.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And this is one of the reasons
why, you know, in addition to

00:25:03.566 --> 00:25:08.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the generator, we have
guidance, including examples

00:25:08.533 --> 00:25:12.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of accessibility statements,
to really try to

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:14.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
promote good practice.

00:25:14.233 --> 00:25:18.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
But, yeah, this issue, I
guess, of what people do or

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
don't is a little
bit beyond our scope.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Another question that also
Jorge might be interested

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
to weigh in.

00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
It was saying: I was
interested to learn that in

00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:33.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Portugal there's a proposed
standard URL pass for

00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:36.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
accessibility statements.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So on a public website if you
write "acessibilidade" in the

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
URL, you should get the
accessibility statement.

00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Are there more countries with
such standard locations?

00:25:48.466 --> 00:25:52.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Eric, first, are you aware of
other countries that have a

00:25:53.033 --> 00:25:54.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
similar practice?

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Yeah. I know
that the Netherlands has a

00:25:57.133 --> 00:25:59.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
standard location where
you can find all the

00:25:59.233 --> 00:26:00.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
accessibility statements.

00:26:00.733 --> 00:26:04.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
That is at the
toegankelijkheidsverklaring.nl.

00:26:04.666 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
And you can find
enough of you of 2,500

00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:12.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
toegankelijkheidsverklaring.

00:26:13.033 --> 00:26:15.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
And that is also the place --
sometimes they're not even on

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
the website or you can't find
them on the website of the

00:26:18.233 --> 00:26:22.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
public sector body, but you
can find them on this website

00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
that is hosted by the
central government.

00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:34.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Jorge,
any other thoughts on this?

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
&gt;&gt; JORGE FERNANDES: Well, I
don't know other countries

00:26:36.933 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
where they use also
the standard URL.

00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:47.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
But, yes, in Portugal
we are using this one.

00:26:47.933 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
For example, I know that in
Italy they centralized the

00:26:52.766 --> 00:26:58.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
accessibility statement
in a website, and you make a

00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
link to that website.

00:27:02.466 --> 00:27:07.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The accessibility statement is
not on the website of the --

00:27:07.866 --> 00:27:14.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
of the public sector bodies,
so it is outside, centralized

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
in a server managed by
the national authority.

00:27:23.466 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
But I don't know other --
or other examples.

00:27:29.566 --> 00:27:30.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Thank you. Yeah.

00:27:30.766 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
And that goes directly
to the next question.

00:27:33.066 --> 00:27:36.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Do all countries adopt this
statement generator, knowing

00:27:36.933 --> 00:27:40.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
that some countries in the EU
have additional requirements,

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:43.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
for example, France
and Netherlands?

00:27:43.366 --> 00:27:46.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
The latter also has
its own generator.

00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:49.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
And then there is the Dutch
name, which I cannot read.

00:27:50.033 --> 00:27:53.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN:
Toegankelijkheidsverklaring.nl.

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:56.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Yeah, be
nice to the captioner, Eric.

00:27:57.033 --> 00:27:58.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN:
Oh, that's trouble.

00:27:58.933 --> 00:27:59.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Having a match.

00:27:59.866 --> 00:28:02.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Woops.

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:03.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Okay.

00:28:03.466 --> 00:28:06.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
So we do not -- yeah.

00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
We provide this accessibility
statement generator as an

00:28:11.766 --> 00:28:15.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
example as the minimum
requirements in the Directive.

00:28:15.933 --> 00:28:18.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Also something internationally
-- this is not only for

00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:20.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Europe, but providing
accessibility statements as a

00:28:20.466 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
best practice internationally.

00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:28.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the expectation is whoever
wants can take it, adapt it.

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:31.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
So this is why Eric mentioned
that you can actually add

00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:36.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
additional questions, so we
try to write the code in such

00:28:36.366 --> 00:28:42.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a way that you can extend this
basis and also translations so

00:28:42.966 --> 00:28:45.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
that you can use
this separately.

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:48.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So, yeah, it's a tool to help.

00:28:48.966 --> 00:28:51.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Some have reused it,
like in Portugal.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Others have not.

00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:55.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And it's totally up to --
you know, to people

00:28:55.666 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
what they do with it.

00:28:57.566 --> 00:28:59.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We did notice -- we did
learn from Portugal that the

00:28:59.533 --> 00:29:02.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
translation was not as easy,
and this is why we're redoing

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that, to support translation.

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Good.

00:29:06.766 --> 00:29:14.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
And then somebody re --
put the Dutch URL again.

00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:16.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
I think somebody wants
to have fun with Dutch.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Good.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Thank you very much, Eric.

00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:20.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
&gt;&gt; ERIC VELLEMAN: Sorry.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA: Dutch
lesson in the next webinar.

00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:26.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Let's now move on.
