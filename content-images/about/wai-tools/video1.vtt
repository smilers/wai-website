&gt;&gt; SHADI ABOU-ZAHRA:
Just a little bit about

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
the project itself.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
WAI-Tools Project is
an acronym for Advanced

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Decision Support Tools for
Scalable Web Accessibility

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Assessments of the Web
Accessibility Initiative.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
So, WAI-Tools.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, it's a project of
the W3C Web Accessibility

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Initiative co-funded by
the European Commission,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
the EC, under the
Horizon 2020 program.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's a so-called
Innovation Action project.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So there are different
types of projects that the

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:38.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
European Commission supports
and this is one of them.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
It's under the line
of innovation action.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
It started on the 1st
of November in 2017.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It also - it already
feels like many decades ago.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And unfortunately
actually, coming to an end

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
at the end of this month.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As I mentioned, it's
been a really great project,

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
great fun working
with the partners.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Speaking of the partners
of the project, the lead

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:08.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
partner is the European
Research Consortium for

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Informatics and
Mathematics, ERCIM which

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:14.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
is the
European host for W3C.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, this is the legal
footing of W3C in Europe.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:20.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Other partners in the
project are Siteimprove

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
from Denmark, the
Accessibility Foundation

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:27.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
in the Netherlands, the
Norwegian Digitalisation

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
Agency, Digdir, and
the Administrative

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Modernization
Agency in Portugal, AMA.

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
The University of Lisbon,
FCID, in Portugal, and

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Deque Research which is
based in the Netherlands.

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:48.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, these are the project
partners who together are

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
responsible for moving
this forward, this project,

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
but really a lot of
this work is happening

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:58.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
or happened in - directly
in open W3C groups and

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we're going to be talking
more about that, about how

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:04.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
the project work has
happened and how you can

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
still contribute to some
of this project work which

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:11.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is going to continue
happening in these groups.

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But just to give you
a little bit of the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
objectives of the project,
what did we really want to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
achieve with the project?

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:23.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
One of the main objectives
here on the screen is an

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
illustration where at
the very top of the

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:28.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
illustration is kind
of the ultimate goal.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We all want
compatible results, right?

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
When we are evaluating
for the Web Content

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Accessibility Guidelines
which is the layer below,

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:38.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
we're evaluating for
accessibility or testing

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
for accessibility,
we're using different

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
methodologies, so
different methods.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But at the end of the day,
we're testing for the same

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:50.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
set of guidelines and we
want to get compatible results.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
We want to get the same
results when we test the same

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:56.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
things, right, no matter
how we actually test them.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And so, this was really
the focus of the project,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to look at what we
call ACT test rules,

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Accessibility
Conformance Testing rules.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The point is these
are very, very small

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:14.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
procedures for testing
that can be combined

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:16.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
together for
different methodologies.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
And methodologies
here is a broad term.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
It could be automated
tools or anything.

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:26.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Any procedure that
you follow for manually

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:29.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
checking, this is a
methodology as well.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, really, anything
that encodes how you check

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
accessibility
is a methodology.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
It could be manual.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
It could be automated.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It could be a combination,
semi-automated, so a combination

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of automated and non-automated
approaches together.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, if we have very small
building blocks, and they

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
are depicted here as these
small boxes, these small

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
squares, very, very small,
like Lego pieces, we can

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
combine these together
to provide different

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:02.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
methodologies but at the
end of the day, if we test

00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:05.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
the same thing, we want
to get the same result.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, that's really the
objective or the vision of

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the project is to try to
get consistency because we

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
know that one of the big
issues of accessibility

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:17.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
right now is that we don't
have that consistency.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
We have different tools
that provide different

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:23.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
results or different
evaluation methods.

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, you go to one person
and you get one result and

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
then sometimes you can get
slightly different results

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when you go to a different
person to get it checked.

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:33.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
That's a big problem for
accessibility that we're

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
trying to address to have
more consistency of how we test.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Another objective of the
project, by defining these

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:45.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
checks and finally
agreeing on them and not

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
having to constantly
re-repeat how we test

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
certain things, how do we
test the text alternative

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
or how do we
test the label.

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:57.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
If we can finally decide
and agree on a common

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
interpretation for
these checks, maybe we

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
can increase
automation in that.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Right now, a very large
part of accessibility

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
needs to be
tested manually.

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:10.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But we also know that
there is a lot of advancements

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
happening in the technology.

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:16.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
Buzzwords, artificial
intelligence or machine

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
learning, natural
language processing.

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:23.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
All of these technologies
are evolving, all of these

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:25.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
innovations that would
essentially allow us to

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
increase the
level of automation.

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
It doesn't mean that
accessibility will be

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
fully automatable, at
least in the foreseeable

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
future, but at least we
can maybe increase the

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:40.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
amount of tool support
which would be - would

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:42.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
make things much more
effective and much more

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:47.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
efficient if we can increase
this level of automation.

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, these are really the
objectives or the core

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:51.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
pieces of the project.

00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The deliverables of the
project, which we're going

00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:57.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
to go into more detail,
but hopefully from a more

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
applied side, is the main
part of the project, the

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:05.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
heart piece is to develop
Accessibility Conformance

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:07.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Testing rules, right.

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, this is to create an
initial set hopefully to

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:14.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
get the work in the
community kickstarted to

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:16.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
help establish an
active community that

00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:20.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
will sustain
beyond the project.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, this is a call on -
call for action for you to

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:27.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
get involved in this
work that will continue

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
beyond the project.

00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:33.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We implemented these
rules that we developed in

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
different tools from
project partners in the

00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
project, here specifically
the partners Siteimprove

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:47.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
in their checker called
Alfa, in Deque in their

00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:52.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
checker called Axe-core,
and in - a tool from the

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
University of Lisbon in
a checker called QualWeb.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:59.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we also validated these
rules in real-life situations.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
We had a set of websites
that we took and that we

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ran these rules across.

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:09.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now, these rules were
applied in different ways,

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
were test-driven, or were
taken up by the Portuguese

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
and Norwegian
observatories.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
These were part of the
project to kind of really

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
ground us and look at when
entire countries want to do

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:25.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
large scale monitoring
of accessibility, what

00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:26.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
are their needs?

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
What can we
learn from that?

00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:30.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And how can we provide
them with different types

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:33.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of rules that
will support getting

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
them valuable information?

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:41.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
We looked at improving the
existing WCAG-EM Report Tool.

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:44.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So, people
might know that tool.

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:45.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
It already existed.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
WCAG-EM stands for WCAG
evaluation methodology.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It actually has a
longer name, Website

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:54.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Accessibility Conformance
Evaluation Methodology.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
It's a long name.

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:59.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
But this is an evaluation
methodology for WCAG that

00:07:59.733 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
can be used to
test entire websites.

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:05.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And it was a tool to help
you walk through that and

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
now we have added to that
tool an import function so

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:11.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
that you can import test
results from automated

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:14.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
tools, again here to
show the idea that we can

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
combine automated and
manual when we're using

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:21.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
open standards here.

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:26.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We also created an accessibility
statements generator tool.

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:30.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, this helps you create
accessibility statements

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
for your website once you
have done the testing to

00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:37.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
explain to the world the
accessibility that you

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:39.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
have on your website.

00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And last but not least, a
demo, a proof of concept

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
to show, to demonstrate
the potential of open

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
linked data
for accessibility.

00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, what if - right -
what if we had these test

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
results being published,
at least those by public

00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
bodies, and we could
connect these and we could

00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
scrape these and we
could do a more active or

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:07.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
decentralized
monitoring approach?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
So, these are the
project deliverables.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
More information
is on the website.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:17.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
We will provide you these
links at the end again so

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:20.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
you don't need to start
looking at the links.

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
The address is
w3.org/WAI/Tools.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
That is the project page
for the WAI-Tools Project

00:09:30.066 --> 00:09:32.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and you can find here
further information, all

00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
the resources, all the
deliverables, including

00:09:36.066 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
this open meeting with
the slides online as well.
